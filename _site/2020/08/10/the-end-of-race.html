<p>Dear White People,</p>

<p>Race is not what you think it is.</p>

<p>Imagine the following scenario: a couple wishes to adopt a child. They are well-off and well-qualified.  A baby comes up for adoption, they are matched, and they are given custody of 7.5 pounds of joy.</p>

<p>Nice story.</p>

<p>So imagine the couple.  Imagine the baby.  Can you see them?</p>

<p>Check here if you imagined:</p>

<p>A white couple adopting a white baby.
A white couple adopting a black baby.
A black couple adopting a black baby.
A black couple adopting (gulp) a white baby.</p>

<p>It is most likely you imagined the first scenario. Don’t feel bad. It doesn’t make you a racist.</p>

<p>Remember, race is not what you think it is.</p>

<p>You probably didn’t think, but are familiar with the concept of white parents adopting black children.</p>

<p>You probably didn’t imagine a black couple adopting a black child.  That’s not just because I specified that the couple was well-off and well-qualified.  You would have imagined a white couple and a white baby regardless of how I described the couple, as long as I didn’t mention their ‘race.’ If you did imagine a black couple and a black baby, you are probably black.</p>

<p>And here’s the clincher: black couple, white baby.</p>

<p>Admit it–you’re having a visceral feeling about it.  It’s not necessarily a negative feeling (although, it may be.) But something about it hits you in the gut. Do yourself a favor and don’t think about it for a minute.  Just feel it.</p>

<p>That feeling you are having right now, there it is: that’s race.</p>

<p>Notice that I’m <em>not</em> saying that race manifests as a culture, a belief system, or a set of behaviors and attitudes. It does, but I’m not saying that–not yet. I’m certainly not saying that race manifests as any kind of genetic profile.  I’m saying that race manifests as an emotion, which is to say, a feeling that motivates behavior, as in <em>evoking motion</em>.</p>

<p>When I pointed out the feeling you were having at the thought of a black couple adopting a white baby, you probably found it hard to just feel, and not immediately start thinking.  “Why?  What is this feeling, what does it mean?””  If you don’t think of yourself as racist, you may worry that the feeling you are having makes you somehow racist.  Of course, if you do think of yourself as racist–or as a ‘racialist,’ or a white supremacist, or what have you–your feelings will be less conflicted, but they will be feelings nonetheless.</p>

<p>Now notice that it is based on that feeling that you start to have thoughts.  These thoughts will vary from person to person–</p>

<p>I’m only having this feeling because black couples adopting white babies is unusual.</p>

<p>I, personally, am okay with it, but I know a lot of people would not be.</p>

<p>I worry the situation will be unnecessarily hard on the white child. Won’t they grow up with a stigma? Won’t they feel like an outsider in their own family?</p>

<p>Healthy white babies are in short supply. Couples spend years trying to adopt a baby of their own race. Is it fair for a black couple to scoop up a white baby?</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if they are well-off and well-qualified on paper.  If they are black they live in a black community, and the child will experience all of the social evils that characterize black culture.</p>

<p>They couldn’t possibly give that child as good a home as an equally well-qualified white couple.</p>

<p>These are just some examples. They range from fairly innocent, to very prejudiced. I could have included a mental rant about mud people, but whatever. The commonality among all these thoughts is that they start with a <em>feeling</em> that something was amiss in the first place (black couple, white baby?) and then struggling to translate that feeling into a belief in keeping with the speakers previously-held beliefs. We should call this process ‘rationalization’ but with a caveat. I don’t use the word ‘rationalize’ in the pejorative sense, as in ‘he was just trying to rationalize his bad behavior.’ To rationalize, here, is to make something fit in, logically, with whatever system of beliefs, be it vague or well-defined, you may already have in place. It’s a normal, natural function of the human mind.</p>

<p>However, it is not, by definition, a process for arriving at <em>objective truths.</em>  It is just a process for handling a feeling and translating it into a belief. But here we also need to take a moment to consider what it meant by the phrase, “Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs.” The fact is, there is no way to separate belief from behavior.  If you believe something, it will affect your behavior.  That is the entire purpose and function of belief in the human mind.  But we would not say, if we are being serious about it, everyone is entitled to their own behavior.  We limit behavior all the time, such as, you know, stabbing people.  The fact that someone believes in stabbing people is okay, as long as they don’t actually stab people.  But, of course, it is <em>not</em> considered okay to believe in going around stabbing people, even if you don’t do it.  We would all avoid someone who espoused an ideology of stabbiness, for fear they would put their beliefs into action.  This, in itself, unmasks the lie that is ‘everyone is entitled to their own beliefs.’ They aren’t.  We avoid people based on their beliefs. We know beliefs are apt to shape actions.</p>

<p>[What happens when white people start putting pressure on each other to not be racist?  The system of racial stratification cannot function if white people do not believe in their own superiority to all others.  But, if that belief is framed in the public mind as a toxic one, the white mind must somehow separate itself from associating with it.  But the belief still has to find a way to stay in control in order to persist in maintaining the behavioral system that is already in play.  Since hierarchy is clearly a very, very persistent and even creative system of behavior, it is no surprise that it has found a way to stay alive, even in the mind of someone who is diligently trying to get rid of it.]</p>

<p>Now, lets be clear on one point: the notion of ‘race’ as a biological construct is a myth.  That is, there is no genetic basis for race, other than the physical features we use to define race. Since we live in a society permeated by the myth of race, this can be a difficult concept to get one’s head around, so it merits expansion.</p>

<p>When you think of the myth of race, think of phrenology.  If you are unaware, phrenology was a pseudoscience popular in the early part of the 20th century.  The idea was that a person’s character could be determined by the shape of their skull.  (This is actually where the terms ‘low brow’ and ‘high brow’ come from.) In particular, bumps on the skull, and their location, were thought to correlate with underlying personality traits, and could be used to identify those prone to criminal behavior.</p>

<p>Eventually, this ‘discipline’ was thoroughly debunked. There was no causal connection between skull shape and behavior, and there was no evidence even of a correlation in practice.</p>

<p>So, when you think of the myth of race, think of phrenology. Think of arbitrary physical features that don’t correlate to someone’s underlying disposition. Because, from the perspective of science (which is the perspective of reality, I should point out) that is what biological arguments about race are: phrenology, under a different name.</p>

<p>Researchers, some of them quite well-intentioned, have poured over the issue of race in countless studies, often with the goal of eliminating confounding variables to get a picture of what ‘race’ is without social inequality, income inequality, lack of resources, etc. What they are addressing is often called the ‘achievement gap’ And when all of those factors are eliminated, it seems like the achievement gap still persists–blacks are still not as wealthy as whites, not as upwardly mobile, or they don’t score as high on IQ tests, etc.  What racist arguments do with this data is insist that there <em>must</em> be some sort of biological basis for the different sets of behaviors we see being evinced by people of different races, at least in American society. Whatever the biological basis is, it is there, it just hasn’t been discovered yet.  And of course scientists, because they are liberals, or they are all in on a conspiracy, are not even looking for it.</p>

<p>[All human behaviors are the products of evolved motivational systems.  No human behavior develops in isolation–all human behaviors develop in concert with other human behaviors.   Thus, all cultures, all social systems, are the result of human behavioral systems that have arisen in the human genome through evolution. The reality of race is as a set of behaviors within a society that are produced by a set of motivational systems that happen to be at work in a particular society at a particular juncture.]</p>

<p>[A suite of genes that finds itself in a host that lives to procreate, and has progeny that do the same, is a suite of genes that ‘survives.’ These genes can sweeten the deal by motivating a characteristic or behavior that increases the creatures odds of survival. Or not. Genes that don’t increase survival (perhaps by doing nothing, which describes most genes) do well to exist in a host where the ‘survival friendly’ genes are hard at work. It is, of course, also possible for genes to work against the survival of an individual member of a species, as long as the species as a whole, that is, its genome, persists and that gene remains a constituent of that genome.]</p>

<p>The myth of race is the product of an evolved motivational system in different, in essence, than the evolved motivational system that makes your cat go crazy chasing around a red dot made by a laser pointer.  Now, the cat did not evolve in an environment that included laser pointers.  But is did evolve around bugs which move about in a similar manner and so it sees in the the laser pointer the kind of motion that triggers a catching behavior.</p>

<p>Humans did not evolve to see race because for the vast majority of our evolution, absolutely everyone had fairly dark skin.  They did, however, evolve to detect differences in relatedness using physical cues. Compared to the black-and-white differences between, well, blacks and whites, these differences would strike us now as quite subtle. But they were painfully obvious and acute during our evolution–just as we associate, rightly or wrongly, certain features with being Italian, the same distinctions could label someone as being from a friendly tribe or a dangerous one. So the faculty was already there.  When the African Diaspora finally met up with itself, the stage was set for the creation of a caste system based on outward appearance.</p>

<p>[They are right.  There is a biological basis for race.  But it is rooted in biology common to all human beings, regardless of their so-called ‘racial’ classification.]</p>

<p>What you didn’t think, I can almost guarantee, is “Good. In fact all white babies should be adopted by qualified black couples whenever possible.  We need to bust up this socially destructive myth of race by any means necessary, and that’s a good start.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, such couples are often praised by strangers for ‘giving the children a good home.’</p>

<h3 id="what-about-racism-without-racists">What about “Racism Without Racists?”</h3>

<p>The expression, “racism without racists” is a good starting point for discussion.  What it means is, even if the vast majority of whites don’t think of themselves as racist, even if they are trying really hard not to be racist, and even if their behavior doesn’t seem super racist–there can still be racism.</p>

<p>But lets keep in mind that the evolved behavioral system behind all this is a ‘racist’ system.  The reason racism can persist despite conscious efforts to combat it is that all those well-intentioned white people are running a program that is shaping their behaviors in a million ways, large and small, that they are unaware of. They are unaware of those things exactly because the system itself evolved to make it difficult–nigh on impossible–for them to be aware of those things.  They create this blind spot for the very practical reason that it helps perpetuate the system. Most people would not be on board with arbitrarily dehumanizing a whole group of people and watching them suffer in pain. So the system that evolved provides a rationale for dehumanizing that group, and also plays a nice little trick with our brains that makes it possible to avoid any really visceral perception of how much we are making that group suffer.</p>

<p>This is a foundational element of all arbitrary hierarchy in human–and perhaps even primate–society.  The hierarchy must be ‘rationalized’ and the perpetrators of dominance must be made, by some means or other, numb to the violence they are perpetrating.  This requires, in humans, a lot of mental tricks–being played on us by the genome itself, mind you–that guarantee that even while whites try to fight against a society’s tendency towards ‘racial injustice,’ they will nonetheless continue to perpetrate it.</p>

<p>This is a good place to pause and remind ourselves of the dangers of the ‘naturalistic fallacy.’ A quick thought might have just popped into your head, “Well, if this system of hierarchy, arbitrary as it may be in some analysis, has evolved, and it has been the societal structure throughout human history, then maybe it is inevitable.  Maybe it is a good thing.”  Now, first of all, remember that your mind is playing tricks on you–or rather, the genome is playing tricks on your mind.  You have been programmed, in a sense, to rationalize the system of hierarchy using whatever arguments you can find.</p>

<p>But also, the naturalistic fallacy states, “Just because it is natural does not mean it is good.” It is safe to say, for instance, that it is ‘natural’ to be so angry with someone that you want to kill them.  Murder is an evolved behavioral system.  That does not mean that murder is good.  In that same way, arbitrary hierarchy will, when the conditions are right, rise up, at least in our minds, as a desirable thing. This does not mean that putting an arbitrary hierarchy into place, in practice, in reality, would be a good thing. It may be understandable that you <em>want</em> to murder your boss. But there can be no ambiguity about the fact that you <em>should not murder your boss!</em></p>

<p>Some professionals specializing in this subject matter will insist that ‘all white people are racist.’  They are not wrong.  Racists will insist that blacks are acting in ways that provoke racial animosity.  They aren’t wrong either.  This is another tack the genome has taken to produce the desired result of a hierarchical system.  First, there are a panoply of mind games the genome plays on the dominant caste.  They simply see the sub-caste using different perceptual systems. The white brain is tricked into seeing the worst and assuming the worst in ways that are not the same when perceiving another white person. That’s your brain on racial hierarchy. Second, the strategies adopted by the sub-caste are different from those embraced, at least consciously, by the dominant caste.  And the genome has set up the white brains to focus on those strategic differences, demonize them, fear them, and credit them to some inherent quality born into the members of the sub-caste.</p>

<p>We may ask why hierarchy–particularly ones enforced by the violent infliction of pain–would be evolutionarily sound.</p>

<p>First, lets remember that, in order to exist within a genome, an evolved behavior need only meet one criteria: it did not result in the excintion of the species.  That’s it.  The behavior did not kill off so many individuals capable of reproduction that the creature in question went the way of the dodo. Had the dodo been scared shitless of Filipino fishermen, it might still be with us today–ludicrous-looking and impractically designed, but still in existence.  But it had one behavior, among all others, that sealed its fate: it was not afraid of Filipino fishermen.  Or, of course, humans in general.</p>

<p>So, when we look at the system of hierarchy that arose in some animals, we shouldn’t look at it as ‘evolved’ in the sense of ‘improved’ or (eegad) ‘enlightened.’ These are a couple of unfortunate synonyms that have–well–evolved from an improper understanding of evolution. An evolved trait is, “That which has developed within a species that has not resulted in the death of that species–at least not yet.”</p>

<p>To put it explicitly, the tendency toward hierarchy in a social animal–at least the ones that exist today–has not killed it off yet. That doesn’t mean it is the best system, even in terms of survival.</p>

<p>If we are learn anything from the dodo, perhaps it should be this: it is possible for a species to exist for millions of years with a behavior which, while not optimal in an objective sense, does not interfere with its survival. Conditions may change, however, and that behavior may wind up being its downfall.</p>

<p>Also, behaviors do not exist in isolation.  Meerkats also have no fear of humans.  But they are not going extinct.  Perhaps because meerkats are spread over a wider geographic area (not bound to an island), reproduce more rapidly, and are harder to kill even if you wanted to (and why would you want to. They are so cute!)</p>

<p>So, even though arbitrary hierarchy has often arisen within our societies in the past, this does not mean that it is the best behavior for the future. Here we differ greatly from the dodos because we have this very complex form of communication called language.  The dodos would have done well to get together and say, “Hey, guys.  These Filipino fishermen are bad news.  Let’s steer clear of them.” Or even, “We need to get off this stupid island. We’re sitting ducks here.  Let’s build a boat and blow this popsicle stand.” But, alas, being as they were dodos, no such conversation took place, and no such plans took shape.</p>

<p>‘Racism’ sounds like a two-way street–or worse, a multi-lane highway.  Racial hierarchy makes it clear that it is not a matter of ‘tit for tat.’ White Supremacist Racial Hierarchy makes it clearer still.  In this context, the term ‘reverse racism’ takes on new meaning. Yes, that is exactly what we are trying to do, reverse racism. That is, dismantle the racial hierarchy.  That is, destroy the myth of white supremacy.</p>

<p>White people are often encouraged to adjust their attitudes and perspectives in the cause of ‘reversing racism.’ But based on our analysis here, lets question whether that is the best idea.  Certainly we don’t want white people to go around <em>perpetuating</em> racism.  But is there really a mental stance that can be assumed that is going to somehow spread from white mind to white mind and thereby contribute to the dissolution of the notion of racial hierarchy in the mind of the society at large?  I’m really asking.  What doesn’t jive is the idea that white people need to take a hard look at themselves in terms of their racial attitudes.  Of course, that would be nice, but it is very hard to do, and most people don’t like to do hard things.  However, since we live in an interconnected framework of minds, all feeding off each other, all running evolved programs that drive, persistently, towards certain behaviors to support certain social outcomes, can we really ask individuals to try to put a halt to that entire process through some course of self-examination?  Guess what, if you are white and you examine yourself for racial attitudes, you will find that you have racist racial attitudes.  Big surprise!  It’s like asking someone in a swimming pool whether or not they are wet.</p>

<p>Mightn’t it be better for white people to adopt a posture that is easier to achieve and maybe just as helpful?  Yes, I am up to my neck in racial memes, I am evolution’s bitch.  The thoughts in my head are not always what I want them to be, my actions are not always in line with what I want to believe.  I’m up to my neck in white supremacy and I’m soaked to the skin in it. This is a terrible situation to be in. That is why I want to ‘reverse racism.’ Not even, necessarily, for the benefit of those racism dehumanizes.  Just to rid myself of the contamination.  Because ultimately, I can’t cleanse the pee out of just my part of the pool.</p>

<p>[Really, when I think about myself as a white person, I think about how angry I am that I am stuck in this disgusting society. That every day I am an unwilling player in this demented reality theatre. The racial caste system in America is an obscenity. I eagerly look forward to the day when I never have to think about it ever again.]</p>

<p>The idea is that the races exist in nature. But the nature they derive from is human genomic nature, which prompts us to concoct the concept of race, and react to it as if it were a real thing that exists in nature.</p>

<p>Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (if you’re a girl) the idea that cultures do really really stupid things for incredibly long periods of time. And while these stupid things are happening, they don’t seem all that weird.</p>

<p>[The human potential movement, as such, is not a matter of individuals rising up, one at a time, to exercise their potential. This is (I’m thinking) the illusion.  For, without the well-tuned system to rise up within, their efforts may be for naught.</p>

<p>Human children has an insatiable appetite for learning.  They will learn whatever a teacher will teach them.  (Within limits which are…) This contributes to the problem.  Any ideology, within limits, can always be taught to subsequent generations. ]</p>

<p>Why?  Why did it never die?  Why did it lay in wait?  Why did extreme circumstances bring it back to life?  By what mechanism?</p>

<p>“Only recently have geophysicists had technology sensitive enough to detect the unseen stirrings deeper in the earth’s core. They are called silent earthquakes. And only recently have circumstances forced us, in this current era of human rupture, to search for the unseen stirrings of the human heart, to discover the origins of our discontents.”</p>

<p>“What humanity learned, one would hope, was that an ancient and hardy virus required perhaps more than anything, knowledge of its ever-present danger, caution to protect against exposure, and alertness to the power of its longevity, its ability to mutate, survive and hibernate until reawakened. It seemed these contagions could not be destroyed, not yet anyway, only managed and anticipated, as with any virus, and that foresight and vigilance, the wisdom of never taking them for granted, never underestimating their persistence, was perhaps the most effective antidote, for now.”</p>

<p>Excerpt From: Isabel Wilkerson. “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents.” Apple Books.</p>

<p>She describes racial animosity as a virus.  A virus spreads from person to person, can only exist in a living host, mutates (adapts) as it goes. Okay. But the evolved behavioral system pre-exists the virus.  And causes the virus?  Trying to get at the feedback loop here.  A virus really is something that comes from outside the human genome.  Sort of.  Viruses, by one name or other, have helped to forge our genome. I’m trying to get at the extent to which the recrudescence of the virus of racial superiority can be blamed on elements inherent in the genome.  We do have this model that a good idea will spread from person to person.  But that exist alongside a model where bad ideas do the same.  The unifying factor is not whether they are good or bad ideas in the modern context.  It is that they attach to evolved behavioral systems.</p>

<p>Maybe it is this.  That it is better–easier for the individual–to blame evolution. Because the virus seems to start with a source–someone inventing an ideology.  And, as we have seen, good things and bad things have the power to spread.  So, what if this thing that had spread to me is good?  Even if it is white supremacy.  For one thing, we need to reckon with why some ideologies ‘feel good.’ That emanates from the genome, certainly.  But also that ideologies spread in a way that deludes the believer.  The part where you receive the all the flaws of character, ethics, and logic that allow you to receive the message is almost more important than the message.  The idea is to explain how so many people can be so ensorcelled, so thoroughly, for such a long period of time, against all efforts to snap them out of it.  It seems like life or death, doesn’t it?  Whether you come together with whoever it is you are in love with, that is.  It is not life or death at all.  It has nothing to do, absolutely nothing to do, in any objective sense, with your personal survival.  In fact, the children you will probably have will, if anything, make your survival–or at least your existence–a lot harder. This is the way it is with an evolved behavior system.</p>

<p>A system of racial hierarchy is something that motivates thinking and belief, which, in turn shapes what you say and what you do.</p>

<p>A bad social system can serve as a rational motivation for bad individual choices.  The fact that you live in a society where single women traveling along may be sexually assaulted means you don’t send your daughters to school.   Not because you are against girls being educated, but to keep them safe.</p>

<p>The dominant and subordinate castes deploy different sets of behaviors.  Now, reality being what it is, these behaviors will differ from one caste system to the other, and within a given caste system over time.  But general principles will be found to hold well enough to serve as evidence favoring someone’s membership in a certain caste.  Now, while it is interesting to get into the details of how the two castes are behaving, and while people should definitely study the details of how the two castes behave differently, it is simply unnecessary to understand these details in order to understand the most important aspects of living in a caste system.  What’s more important is that, in a caste system, members of the dominant caste fill focus on the behavior of the subordinate caste and, whatever it is, use it against them in ways that reinforce and strengthen the caste system.  No group-level behavior that emanates from the sub-caste can ever be used to legitimate the existence of the caste system, since that group behavior derives from the existence of the group, and it is the existence of the grouping (the sub-caste) that is the problem.</p>

<p>Interestingly, opioid use was once considered a sub-caste behavior, but now has caught on among whites in epidemic proportions. Heroin use was once linked to blackness as a weakness in character emanating from a different gene pool. The response to that was always that the black community was targeted by a coalition of white forces–the mob, the government, and whatnot.  And that if the white community were targeted in the same way, the same thing would happen.  And look what happened.  The white community <em>was</em> targeted, this time by the drug companies, and the same thing <em>did</em> happen.</p>

<p>So, anytime we quote a statistic about the sub-caste, we may be describing objective reality, at least at that moment and for the population in question, but we are not actually describing a characteristic of that group.  Most importantly, and to our point here, we are not describing a problem, within <em>their</em> group, that <em>they</em> need to solve before whites can agree to lift the stigma imposed on being black.</p>

<p>Research points overwhelmingly and unambiguously to the fact that whites in the US behave differently towards and think differently about people of of color. More to the point, when they think differently about blacks, they tend to do so in a certain direction. Consider these conclusions:</p>

<p>Blacks are more patriotic than whites, as measured by participation in the armed forces.</p>

<p>Blacks have more self-control than whites as measured by alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>Blacks are more optimistic than whites as measured by lower suicide rates.</p>

<p>And even…</p>

<p>Blacks are more likely to go to heaven than whites as measured by church attendance.</p>

<p>These are all viable conclusions to reach about black people in the US, but these attitudes are not the ones expressed by whites.  Attitudes expressed have to do with rates of crime, sexual promiscuity, ‘family values,’ work ethic, intelligence, and the like.  Whites tend to hold negative impressions of blacks on such issues. Since there is no disputing the facts, those defending these opinions point to statistics which support their conclusions.  But what they don’t defend is why they focus on this set of qualities rather than some other set, such as the ones mentioned above.  Also, why do they attribute them to some feature of ‘blackness’ rather than a part of the human condition?  Finally, why is the analysis not this: “To the extent we see group differences between whites and blacks, given that we are all human in exactly the same way, the differences must be attributable to the painfully obvious, heartbreakingly unjust system of white supremacy at work in the US since before its founding until this day.”</p>

<p>It’s not that blacks are ‘hurt’ by white racism and so they ‘act out.’ I think this is a real cause of confusion.  When we say that ‘black behavior’ is ‘caused by’ white racism, we may inadvertently bring to mind a resentful child who doesn’t feel they are getting enough love (or whatnot) and so is ‘acting out.’ Without opening up a discussion of childrearing, it is easy to see that many people think (rightly or wrongly) that such a child needs to suck it up to some extent, realize that life isn’t always fair and that their parents are people, and grow up.  Again, this isn’t necessarily the perspective an expert would take, or even the correct perspective, but it is a familiar and pervasive one.</p>

<p>The tendency for whites to deal with blacks using a program that is already in place for children is another symptom of the existence of an arbitrary racial hierarchy.</p>

<p>Back to the point: behaviors arise in reaction to context, yes, but they do so based on genomically-approved behavioral potentials.  Its not that blacks behave ‘in reaction’ to white racism, its that they behave according to the evolved systems that are most likely to be operating when one finds oneself on the underside of an oppressive racial hierarchy.  A different suite of behaviors tends to crop up in any group that finds itself in such a situation.</p>

<p>The behaviors that rise up in both the dominant caste and the sub-caste are not the result of rationality or logic as such (that is, behaviors can have a sort of situational rationale or logic, without being objectively logical.  Here we are getting into the insufficiency of our terminology.)  The point is that attitudes and behaviors in both castes are the product of genomic behavioral systems that developed in an environment where absolute rationality was not an option.  And they developed in an organism which, uniquely among all living things, is in fact perfectly capable of logic.  So, when hierarchy deploys, it deploys as a system with a very powerful set of tools that target logic and reason to achieve its goals.  This has to be the case.  We can be sure that social hierarchy existed in our ancestors long before our brains developed their impressive neo-cortex.  That means that hierarchy, where it existed, was instinctive and unquestioned, in the sense that no proto-human sat pondering the justice of the system.  But once our neo-cortex developed sufficiently, especially with the development of language, one presumes, it became possible to have such thoughts and ask such questions.  Now, whether or not arbitrary hierarchy was the ‘best’ idea for human social groups, or even the only one possible, for it to survive, it needed to adapt.  And since it certainly <em>did</em> survive, it certainly did adapt. Since arbitrary hierarchy is fundamentally, well, arbitrary, it had to adapt in a way that blinded the members–particularly the dominant caste members–to the perception of the fundamental injustice of the system.</p>

<p>It did this by evolving a set of tools with the genome that could be brought into play when hierarchy was in place: a preset potential for certain kinds of belief systems, pleasure at interacting with those systems, exploiting perceptual systems to create bias based on group membership, tapping into very old systems such as the ones that make us find certain foods disgusting to create social disgust, and the list goes on.  It’s important to remember that it is not necessarily true that the systems governing social hierarchy <em>had</em> to persist for humans to survive.  Evolution is a tinkerer, not an architect. It must work with whatever already exists in a species’ genome.  It is hard to say that <em>anything</em> had to evolve the way it did in order for a species to survive, or even that its absence would mean the death of the species (aside from, you know, the ability to breath air and such.) In saying this, our terminology is also getting a bit muddled.  Because we are talking about the perpetuation of a species.  But we are all descended from a vast array of species that no longer exist because they evolved into some other species.  [So, I need to clean up my terms here.]</p>

<p>The case for the existence of an arbitrary hierarchy based on the social construct of race can be made using Bayes’ Rule, which is, of course, the strongest possible methodology for supporting any assertion.  First, we take the assertion as above, and we put it in a reference class of arbitrary social hierarchies. For the moment, we leave race out of the equation.  We ask the question, “Is there a separation between groups in this society that shares the characteristics of other societies with arbitrary social hierarchies.” So, we start by looking at American society, and we ask how the power is distributed, and compare these observations to other hierarchies that we all agree were arbitrary, like the caste system in India, the class system of European feudalism, and anything else that belongs in our reference class, such as the division between Tutsis and Hutus in Rwanda.  (I’m moving evidence back and forth between prior and posterior, as happens.)  Then we need to see how likely this evidence would be in a society that DOES NOT have an arbitrary hierarchy, if we can find any.  I’m thinking Iceland?  Some other Scandinavian countries? Can we use Cuba?  While we are at it, what about Brasil?</p>

<p>Of course, I take it as an article of faith at this point that such an analysis, properly done, would show that we do, in fact, have an arbitrary hierarchy at work in the United States.  But then I am defining my terms in a way that is…new.  I am saying that evidence that a system of hierarchy is non-arbitrary, such as behavioral differences between the groups I’m saying constitute ‘castes,’ must be seen as being caused by the arbitrary hierarchy, and therefor are not a rationale for it.</p>

<p>So, is that a separate concern?  Or am I wrapped up in a tautology? Because race is a myth, it is an arbitrary criterion for hierarchy.  So, there is no such thing as a non-arbitrary hierarchy based on race. But, we can ask if the US has an arbitrary hierarchy <em>not based on race,</em> and compare this to the one that is.  Hmmm.</p>

<p>Social mobility is thwarted where a caste system exists. If we find that members of the dominant caste are more ‘upwardly mobile’ than members of the sub-caste it is not evidence that the hierarchy is non-arbitrary, and that members of the sub-caste are, somehow, inherently lazy or unskilled. It is evidence of the existence of the cast system itself.</p>

<p>Addressing an injustice will always feel ‘unfair’ to those who have benefitted from that injustice.</p>

<p>Alright, so, if we don’t allow the behavior of a group to become evidence that a hierarchy is non-arbitrary, we do so on the basis of the pre-existence of an arbitrary hierarchy, which is a tautology. We have to say, “If a hierarchy is non-arbitrary, is this the type of evidence we would expect to see.”</p>
