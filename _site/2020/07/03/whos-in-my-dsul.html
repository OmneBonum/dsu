      <p>The short answer to this question is very simple: voters who are registered to vote in your congressional district can vote in your Democracy Straight-Up Legislature (DSUL).</p>

<p>That is:</p>

<p>Step One: Register to Vote (if you are not already)</p>

<p>Step Two: Go to the Democracy Straight-Up website (or have a more tech savvy person do it for you) and Take Your Seat in your district’s DSUL.</p>

<p>So, there is no need to worry that people who are not citizens will join your DSUL. Also, voters that don’t live in your district will not be members of your DSUL.  Also, also, voters will not be able to participate in or vote in more than one DSUL.</p>

<p>It’s a simple as that.</p>

<p>Or is it?</p>

<p>How do you prove that you are a registered voter?</p>

<p>Every state provides voters with some sort of Voter Registration card.  Each card has some sort of voter id number.  Each state also has a publicly available database where you can double check that at voter with a certain name, living at a certain address is, in fact, a registered voter with a specific id number.</p>

<p>This is where the inevitable, unavoidable tiered system of representation comes in really handy.  If you don’t want someone who is not a registered voter in your district to join your DSUL, don’t let them join your Top Group.  Whether or not they have a voter registration card on them, you can sit them down, fill out a query on your state’s voter registration website, and find out if they are in the database.</p>

<p>But what if an entire Top Group is composed of cheating cheaters, none of who are really registered to vote in your district, but lying liars that they are, claim to be registered in your district.  Well, that is where the Upper Tier comes in handy: your Top Group delegate will be a member of Upper Tier Group, along with 10 or 15 other Top Group delegates.  Make sure your delegate double checks that all the members of all the other groups represented by herhis fellow delegates are legit.</p>

<p>Now, an Upper Group reps about 50 to 150 voters.  What if an entire Upper Group is a bunch of lying cheaters?  Well, they will need to put forward a delegate to the Mid-level, and they would need to find a group of 15 to 25 delegates, representing thousands of people, all of whom are in on the conspiracy to infiltrate your district legislature…</p>

<p>And there are still two more levels of structure in your tiered system of delegation where the legitimacy of the qualifications of the voters can be scrutinized. In fact, the only way for invalid voters to gain a vote in your DSUL would be if your local Registrar of Voters were fraudulently registering voters. Never say never, but that kind of fraud is insanely rare.  It is much more likely that you will encounter voters who should, by all rights, qualify to be legally registered but, for some reason or another, are not showing up in your state’s database of registered voters.</p>

<p>Such cases will be uncommon, but every voter counts, so you will need a method for potential voters to appeal the verdict of your state’s on-line database. The DSUp will help you with that, but ultimately, it will be up to you to form a committee in your DSUL to help you deal with such issues.</p>

<p>Which is as it should be. You wouldn’t want us (a bunch of people who are very likely from outside your district and even from outside your state) telling you who is and isn’t in your direct legislature.</p>

<p>On a more technical note, while we provide a voter ID field for each voter who Takes a Seat in their D-Leg, we won’t be the ones using that field to double-check the legitimacy of that ‘sign-up’.  The voters in that DSUL will be the ones doing the checking.</p>

<p>What if you are eligible to vote, but not currently registered to vote?</p>

<p>About 20% of legal citizens who are eligible to vote are not registered to vote.  Getting registered needn’t be a huge hurdle, but it is trickier for some people than it is for others. So, when someone wants to join the DSUL, but is not yet registered, we’re confident their fellow members will help them out in that regard. This is yet another benefit of using the small group as the organizing unit of our DSUL.</p>

<p>Also, though we like to be careful when it comes to predictions, we do hope that this direct legislation project will have the effect of getting more people interested in voting, and therefore registered to vote.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this number, 20%, is high compared to most other developed, democratic countries.</p>

<p>In addition, we estimate that bout 18% of registered voters don’t actually vote, even in a presidential election (which has, reliably, the highest turnout). Again, this is not a great number when compared to other democracies, and we hope one of the side effects of this project is that that number will go down.</p>

<p>But let us remember what a DSUL really is: it is a means to an end.  And the endpoint is instructing your legally-elected House rep how to vote.  Your DSUL gets to tell your rep how to vote because shehe can cast their vote based on any considerations they please, and, in this case, as someone committed to voting with the majority of your DSUL, that is the basis your rep will use.</p>

<p>However, the DSUL itself is not a legally constrained entity.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>We keep on touting the virtues of using the small group as the fundamental unit of Democracy Straight-Up. Here is where it really earns its place.  Ensuring that anyone who joins the DSUL has the right to do so under the rules laid down by the DSUL itself falls first and foremost to the other members of the small group of six to twelve.</p>

<p>But what if they try to break the rules?  What if they try to sneak in one or more people who aren’t qualified to join?  What if all twelve of them are trying to pull a fast one?</p>

<p>This is where the tiered system of delegation comes in very handy.  This group has to elect a delegate to represent them.  That delegate has to join a group of other delegates in tier one.  These groups are voluntary.  So, if a delegate that wants to join a tier one group will run into trouble if some or all of their base members aren’t really qualified to be in the DSUL.</p>

<p>One can imagine, however, ten or twenty such delegates getting together at the tier one level, forming a group, and electing a delegate to tier two!  We are talking possibly a hundred people or more, all of whom are not qualified to join the DSUL, and all of whom are, for some reason, trying to sneak in.</p>

<p>Luckily, the groups forming tier two have the same right to accept or reject members as they please. That means, if they are doing due diligence, they can weed out any attempts at outright fraud.</p>
