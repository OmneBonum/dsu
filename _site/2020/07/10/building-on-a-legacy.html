      <p>The DSUp Project advocates the creation of direct ‘citizen legislatures,’ (which we sometimes call D-SULs for short) in all 435 congressional districts in the United States.</p>

<p>It proposes to do so without changing any laws or amending the constitution, for the simple reason that there is no reason to do so. Everything we need, in terms of a legal framework, already exists. The first amendment, with its guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, already protects against any impediment being placed by government at any level to the creation of a constituent legislature in any given locality.</p>

<p>To be clear, we foresee representatives being elected to congress in exactly the same way they always have, according to existing election laws.  The only difference is, in districts where a DSUL is in place, that constituent-run legislature will hand the representatives her/his marching orders when it comes to what arguments to make on the floor, what deals to cut, and how to vote on legislation.  That is, the representatives vote will reflect the will of the direct legislature which will embody the will of the entire constituency.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that, for all practical purposes, nothing stands in the way of representatives of congress casting their votes in any way they see fit. They may vote with the sentiments of the majority of their constituents. Or not. They may cut a deal with other representatives or yield to pressure from the political party they belong to. They can vote to protect the interests of the people who gave them the most in campaign contributions–sadly.  (This is something DSUp should remedy.) They can flip a coin, consult the I Ching, or ask themselves the age-old question “What would Beyonce do?”.  The only thing they can’t do is take a bribe.</p>

<p>Now, a representative that routinely votes against the interests of her/his base is taking a risk.  She/he can always be ousted by the constituents in the next election. Of course, this check on irresponsible representation doesn’t necessarily function very well in the current context.  Constituents, by and large, have little idea what their representative does and doesn’t vote for. (It is important to point out that this lack of awareness should not be seen as apathy or laziness, but as learned helplessness or rational ignorance, as discussed elsewhere.)</p>

<p>The ideal, however, is that of a representative with constituents that know what they want, and who always votes to reflect their will.</p>

<p>This is the ideal that is achievable with a system of direct legislation.</p>

<p>This may prompt some people to ask, if the DSUL is making all of the decision, what does the representative do?</p>
