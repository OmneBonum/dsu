      <p>The site strives to be politically neutral.  But we need to be careful: political neutrality may be used to sneakily support a biased agenda.</p>

<p>A good way to see this is to think of an earlier version of the Democracy Straight-Up Project.  It was called ‘The Civil Democracy Project.’ At the time, it seemed like a good idea.  “Civil” has the connotation of being for, by and about the people as opposed to the muck-a-mucks in charge.  So, that seemed nice.  But ‘civil’ also has the connotation of being polite and respectful and like that.  And that’s a good thing, too, right?</p>

<p>Actually, no, it isn’t. Think about it.  Who are we to tell you how to be?  If you feel the need to be rude and disrespectful, who are we to police your behavior? It’s possible your opponent in a discussion holds an opinion that is so utterly repugnant, rudeness and disrespect are the only moral option in terms counter their argument.  This leads to the trouble with the term ‘bi-partisan.’ Bi-partisanship clearly has its place.  But it can also be used as a way to bully the other side into concessions they aren’t comfortable with. It can be a way of closing down an argument before the most contentious issues are addressed.</p>

<p>This may be the flaw in many a project falling under the general rubric of ‘direct democracy.’ They always seem to think, implicitly or explicitly, that shoving citizens who bitterly disagree with each other into the same room and encouraging them to duke it out will somehow result in love, peace and understanding–or something like that. But you really have to ask yourself, how much of your day do you want to devote to being locked in battle with people who you despise? Do you really want us to lecture you about ‘active listening’ or give you self-help advice about ‘getting to yes?’</p>

<p>How about this philosophy: “The other side is wrong, they will never be convinced that they are wrong, so the only option is to outvote them, pass the legislation, and prove them wrong!” The project itself, clearly, can’t take that position.  But you can.  And we can at least refrain from trying to psych you out of that position, perhaps on the basis that you aren’t behaving in a ‘civil’ manner towards your fellow citizens?</p>

<p>Once you get to know the project better, you will notice an interesting feature that we think, over time, will cause controversy.  If you read about the <a href="/2020/07/08/the-fundamental-unit.html">fundamental unit of democracy</a></p>
