      <p>Proxy Voting: What is Up With That?</p>

<p>Proxy voting may seem a bit odd, at first.  People are alarmed at the idea of giving up their vote to someone else to let them control it.  This is very ironic, because…think about it.  We’ve all been surrending our voting power, obligated, in essence, to sign over our proxy on every vote that comes before congress to our elected representative every two years!  We’ve been ‘giving up’ the power to control our votes ever since we were old enough register!  When it comes to legislation, proxy voting is the only system of voting we have ever known!</p>

<p>And yet, sometimes when we here at the DSUp Project propose proxy voting as part of our implementation of a direct legislature, people start to take exception.  They become suspicious. “Why am I signing over my right to vote to someone else?  What if I don’t like what they do with it?”  get very aware of what a proxy is, and they start to get very possessive of their votes.  This is healthy, of course.  Because it is your vote.  It is your possession.</p>

<p>So, keep in mind: it is always your vote to cast as you see fit. The system of proxy voting is there for your convenience.  It allows you to delegate the responsibility of making a final decision to someone else–someone called, quite creatively, a delegate.  Why would you want to do this?  For one thing, you can’t know everything about everything all the time. Conditions change and a delegate might have to react quickly to those changes. So, you appoint someone who you trust to vote how you would vote under those new conditions.</p>

<p>Assigning your proxy also gives you power.  How does that work?  Your district legislature is, unavoidably, inevitably, a tiered system.  That means, if your representative has, say, ten proxy votes at tier one, she/he can hand them on to their delegate at tier 2.  That person could have proxy votes from ten or more people themselves, and on through the process of delegation.  Ultimately, there’s a small group of people who work directly with your representative and each other.  Each represents a different tranche in your districts, which might have different ideas about what needs to be done legislatively.  If your delegate at that level has thousands of proxy votes in their pocket, they can use them to help get you and the people in your tranche what they want.</p>

<p>Let’s look at that again.  You give your delegate your proxy on something that you could go either way on.  It’s not that important to you.  A lot of other people at the base level do the same.  Because groups at each tier come together based on affinity, it is likely that delegates with proxies on that issue are in the same group.  They can either turn those votes into firm votes–votes which will remain yes or no, unless you change them yourself–or they hand them as proxies to the representative at the next tier.  Again, if many people in their group have proxies, and they all hand their proxies to the delegate at the next tier, it is possible for a delegate nearer to the representative to have thousands of discretionary votes.</p>

<p>Now, horse-trading becomes possible.  Remember, horse-trading is not a bad thing!  It’s only a bad thing when it happens behind closed doors, or for corrupt purposes. This kind of horse-trading will happen right out in the open, and for your benefit. When others negotiate and make compromises on your behalf, it is only a problem when their decisions seem, to you, mysterious and unfounded. If you trust implicitly the person making decisions on your behalf, you may be able to say to yourself, “Well, I’m sure they had good reason for making that decision.” But you don’t just have to trust if you don’t want to.  You can ask for an explanation.  And if you aren’t satisfied, you can vote out the offending delegate.</p>

<p>[don’t know where to put the following]</p>

<p>If you’ve pondered over the unavoidably inevitable system of tiered delegation proposed by the DSUp Project, you may have noticed something interesting.  Something perhaps alarming, but we think it is quite awesome.</p>

<p>Your base group gets together and elects a delegate that you can recall at any time.  This delegate now functions at the tier one level, and groups together with other delegates representing other base groups. They elect a delegate to tier two.  And so on, until there is a small group of about ten people working with the representative–we could even call this the Delegation to the Representative.  Each represents about a 10th of the voters participating in the DSUL.</p>

<p>But what happens if a base group votes out their delegate? They are free to do this at any time.  That means that delegate is no longer a tier one delegate and can’t join a tier one group.  That means she/he is no longer a member of any group at any tier of the delegation process.  They are no longer a member of the Delegation to the Representative!</p>

<p>It is a bit alarming.  But think of the benefits.  A base group knows their delegate best.  If they turn against their delegate all-of-a sudden, it’s likely there is a reason.  Now, if it is a bad reason, all the delegate has to do is find another base group that will reinstate her/him.  But, if it is a good reason, they may need to slink off into the shadows and let someone else take their place.  This way, whatever it is they did, there doesn’t necessarily need to be a big public scandal about it.  The former delegate doesn’t need to be tried in the media.  The people around them have deemed that person no longer fit to serve.</p>
