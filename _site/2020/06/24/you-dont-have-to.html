      <p>Well, actually, you have to read this–this message. And this short explanation of the Democracy Straight-Up Project. But beyond that, you really don’t need to plow through all the other posts in this blog.</p>

<p>Of course, if you are the kind of person who enjoys getting into the nitty-gritty of things, dig right in!  Read every post.  But if you are not, fear not: you can delegate that job to someone else!</p>

<p>You are the CEO and America is your company, so to speak.  A good CEO actually doesn’t get into the weeds on every issue.  She/he hires good people who’s job it is to sum things up and report back.</p>

<p>You can start doing that right now.</p>

<p>At a minimum, you can find someone who likes to read this sort of thing and ask them to go through it and report back to you.</p>

<p>Or, you can find several people, and divide the work among you.  This a good process to engage in because in order to join the direct legislature in your district, you’ll need to<br />
get together with six to twelve people anyway–people you know in real life, who live and vote in your district. This is explained in the post The Fundamental Unit (a good example of the kind of thing you won’t have to read once you and your group have a delegate to do it for you.)</p>

<p>You can start by naming your group and signing up.  You’ll have to elect one person from among you to serve as delegate.  Don’t worry, you’ll always be able to change your mind.</p>

<p>Or, if you aren’t at the point where you are enthusiastic about joining, still, find some other people, and divvy up the job of reading what’s on the site.</p>

<p>Or, find someone who you think might one day make a good future delegate for your future group and ask them check out the site and get back to you.</p>

<p>Or, if you think you’d make a good delegate, you can read through the site and then try to get five other people onboard to form a group with you, and, hopefully they will elect you as their delegate.</p>

<p>Don’t get us wrong.  We are not saying, “Just sign up, join the direct legislature in your district, and don’t ask any questions.” Ask all the questions you want, but do it at your own pace.  Don’t expect everything to make sense immediately.  Don’t feel like you have to figure it all out on your own.  And don’t be afraid to delegate!</p>

<p>Many pro-democracy projects want to turn everyone into the same type of person, all interacting with the democracy-at-large in the same ways.  Not us. We say, you are the boss and you get to be any kind of boss you want to be.  You can be hands on or hands off.</p>

<p>Now, in order to vote directly on federal legislation–which is the goal of this site–you will eventually need to sign up with a small group of six-to-twelve other voters in your district.  But, again, you can delegate all of that.  The only obstacle is finding a group of at least five other people to join.</p>

<p>Then it’s just a matter of working with your delegate to iron out what you need from them.</p>

<p>After that, you can spend as much or as little time as you wish thinking about legislation and still get your 100% effective vote on every bill going before the House.</p>
