      <p>As you may have read elsewhere, joining your district’s direct legislature entails joining a small group of six to twelve other voters and electing a delegate from among your number to be a first tier delegate. This minimum requirement means that pretty much every citizen that wants to participate can do so. It can be as easy as a friend calling you up and saying, “Hey, we have five people counting me.  Want to be the sixth?”</p>

<p>“Uh, sure, I guess.”</p>

<p>And you’re in.</p>

<p>Once you are in you have to do a few easy things.  First you need to vote for your delegate.  Once your group establishes who will be their tier one representative, you need to have a chat with them.</p>

<p>You will be voting directly on bills as they come before congress.  You will want to work out with your delegate the kinds of issues that matter to you, and the kinds of things you would like to learn more about.  Of course, you may want to start thinking about and discussing a bill well-before it is scheduled for a vote.  So, it is up to a delegate to use their wits to give you a heads up when it looks like a bill is gaining momentum and might make it to the floor for a vote.  (Actually, this site will help your delegate out by providing access to the resources they need, but you don’t need to worry about that unless you want to be a delegate.)</p>

<p>Your delegate should, ideally, be someone you know and trust.  If that’s not possible, it is someone who you should, eventually, grow to know and trust.  If that doesn’t happen, find a new delegate.  If no one in your group fits the bill, find another group.</p>

<p>This is the way it will work: your delegate starts off having a proxy vote on every bill–that is, they can vote for you, however they see fit.  That means you start off in the same position you were in before the direct legislature existed–you’ve just elected someone who is going to vote for you for the foreseeable future.  But here’s the difference–you can take your proxy back whenever you like.  You could say to your delegate on day one, “I take back all my proxies, I want to vote directly on everything.” Then, when you’ve made up your mind on a given bill, you can got on the site and tick a box next to the bill, “Yea,” “Nay” or “Present.” You don’t even have to go on the website.  You can just tell your delegate to do it for you. (The site will give them that access, unless you revoke it, which you can.)</p>

<p>Now, the first concern many people express at this point in learning about the proxy-voting process is, what if my delegate uses my vote in a way that is against my wishes?  And the easy, somewhat snarky, reply is, well, you chose the wrong delegate!  Your delegate’s job is to vote for you only when you when you don’t know or care either way.  Your delegates job is to have a good enough relationship with you, as regards your voting preferences, to be able to assist you in coming to a decision as to your final vote, or to take your proxy and put it to good use.  (Proxies can be used as powerful bargaining chips. More on this here.)</p>

<p>And remember, you will be able to vote on the bill through your DSUL for along time before the final vote on the floor of the House, and you will be able to change that vote whenever you like, right up to the moment the vote closes on the floor of the House.  But what if you’ve given your delegate your proxy, and then they cast your vote, but then you realize you disagree with how they voted for you?</p>

<p>First off, ask yourself if you did a good enough job communicating your voting preferences to your delegate.  Second, you could have turned your proxy vote into a solid yes or no, which your delegate could not change, at any time in the process. Third, consider electing a new delegate. Finally, remember that all your life you’ve been electing representatives who have voted on your behalf in ways that you disagree with.  With the DSUp system of direct legislation, however, this will happen much less often, and you’ll have much more control over it.</p>
