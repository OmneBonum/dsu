    <div class="post-content">
      <p>This issue is somewhat fraught. Fraud at the polls is always a concern. There have been times in our nation’s history where politicians and political parties have ‘stuffed the ballot box’. And now that voting is increasingly done electronically, the task of rigging an election seems like it would be easier than ever. Each year, the House of Representatives votes on hundreds of bills. And now we are saying that hundreds of millions of people will be voting on each of those bills. How can we possibly be assured that all those votes are accurately totaled?</p>

<p>Let us not forget that no human enterprise is free from perfidy. (That’s right, perfidy.  It’s a good word.  Look it up!) When it comes to ensuring the accuracy of any vote, there are two major factors that come into play: transparency and vigilance.</p>

<p>To understand transparency, think of the following example.  I am president of a club with 10 other members. I am up for re-election, and I want to stay president–and I’m willing to cheat to do it.  We come up with a ballot that lists several candidates. We meet and the members vote by secret, anonymous ballot, checking the box next to the candidate of their choice.  I receive the ten votes, count them, and announce that I am the winner!</p>

<p>Did I just pull a fast one? This is obviously bad system for ensuring the accuracy of the vote.  Let’s keep that in mind.  A bad system produces a dubious outcome.</p>

<p>So, we improve the system. Each ballot is filled out, sealed in an envelope and placed on a table in full view of all members. The ballots are still secrete–no one knows who voted for whom–and anonymous–there are no names associated with any given ballot.  We certify a third party, not a member of the club, to open each envelope, announce the vote out loud, and record it.  They may even pass the ballot to two more impartial judges, who confirm the first person’s reading of the ballot. Any member who wishes to see a ballot may do so upon request.</p>

<p>Now we are getting into more familiar territory.  When the vote is small enough, and everyone voting can keep their eyes on the ballots, and the transparency is there in terms of looking at the ballots, we can start to be pretty confident that the outcome reflects how people actually voted.</p>

<p>But what happens when the number of voting members is larger?  A hundred? A thousand? Or, as in the case of a direct legislature, hundreds of thousands?  No individual would be able to sit and evaluate each ballot personally.  Some division of labor would be needed, and, of course, the more people are involved, the more difficult oversight becomes, and the more chances arise for perfidy (there’s that word again). For instance, someone can manufacture ballots and slip them in with the others. Since there are no names on the ballots, there is no way of confirming that each ballot came from an actual voter.  Of course, we could know the total number of voters, and if we had more ballots than voters, we would know something was amiss.  But what?  Which ballots are fakes?  And if I’m rigging the vote, and I introduced many ballots for myself, all I would need to do is subtract that many from the total (perhaps selecting ballots that were checked for one of my opponents.) Provided I was clever and my ruse went undetected, no one would ever know (at least not for sure) that it happened.</p>

<p>Of course, I probably couldn’t do it alone. If, for instance, we established careful rules for chain of custody of the votes, as they were transported between the voters and the vote counters, and I wanted to swap out some of the ballots to favor my election, I would need to find some way around those rules, perhaps enlisting co-conspirators in my scheme.  There is risk in that, though, if one of those co-conspirators should turn on me and spill the beans.  But it could be done.  It has been done!</p>

<p>Provided no evidence is left behind, provided the recorded number of ballots equals the recorded number of voters, and provided none of my co-conspirators rats me out, we are left with a situation where it is very hard to prove fraud.</p>

<p>But this problem can be solved by making the vote secret, but no longer anonymous.  That is, if fraud is suspected, we try to match up ballots and voters, and see how often a voter says, “Wait, that’s not how I voted!” We can do this by collecting suspicious ballots, and calling in the voter who’s name appears on each one, or we can take a random sample of all the votes, and confirm with each voter to ensure accuracy.  Here, statistics will come into play.  The sample has to be truly random, has to be large enough, and the outcome will always produce some anomalies–people who insist they voted the other way, people who can’t be found, etc. So the amount of fraud has to be large enough to be unlikely due to the kinds of random errors that pop up in any large, complicated system. We might also ask, are the anomalies enough to sway the final vote–a slightly different question, since fraud may have occurred, but may have failed in its goal of swaying the outcome of the election.</p>

<p>This process of contacting voters and rechecking the vote is a good idea, and, in fact, it is one of the things the DSUp Project will do for your DSUL, at least in the early stages.  Later on you can hire someone else to do it, or do it yourself.  Or, of course, you can always stay with us, although eventually, the service will no longer be free.</p>

<p>Of course, this does mean that some group of people–presumably trustworthy–will have access to a list that shows how people voted. Perhaps the list will only be of a large sample of voters, but still–you’ll be trusting someone (members of your own DSUL, some third party vendor, or us) with that information. And, where ever there is trust, there is, sadly, the potential for monkey business.</p>

<p>For instance, lets generate a list of 400 voters taken from all voters in our district legislature, noting for each how they voted on a particular bill.  A staff of ten people calls them all in the course of a day, and finds no appreciable difference between the votes that have been recorded, and the self-reports of the voters.  So, no monkey business, right?</p>

<p>Well, not necessarily–to understand this, you have to imagine that there are two lists of voters–the accurate list and the doctored list. The accurate list faithfully records how each voter has voted. The doctored list has changed thousands of, say, ‘No’ votes into ‘Yes’ votes.  If I can fix it so that, when calling people to confirm the vote, we use list the accurate list, that process will result in the conclusion that the vote is good. But I could then use the doctored list to calculate the overall vote totals.  And, as long as no one knows that there are two separate lists, I can rig the vote.</p>

<p>Of course there are ways around this, but the simplest, cheapest, most fool-proof way is to publish the list of votes.  This eliminates the secrecy requirement we started out with, but benefits us in terms of transparency.  This is how most legislatures around the world operate, where a list of legislators, and how they voted, is made available to the public. Now that we have computers, of course, this can take the form of a spreadsheet, or raw data that can be loaded into a spreadsheet, so that any citizen can confirm the vote total. At the same time, looking at the exact same list, any individual legislature can confirm that their vote was recorded correctly.  And, if your DSUL functions in this way, you can do the same: you can both re-calculate the final vote based on the raw data, and confirm that your vote (or your friend’s vote, or a random sample of votes) was/were recorded accurately.</p>

<p>Now, notice that, in this scenario, everyone has access to your personal voting record. This can be an uncomfortable situation for some.  It makes sense that the votes, bill by bill, of a sitting representative are a matter of public record–they represent their constituents, who have a right to know how the person they elected is voting.  But what about you, as an individual?  You may want your employer or your spouse to know how you voted on a particular issue.  You have the right to conduct your life as your please: if you want to espouse one position personally or professionally, and privately vote the other way, that’s your decision.</p>

<p>So, we are dealing with an unavoidable dynamic here–the more privacy we provide voters as to how they voted, the more opportunities there are for fraud.  The more transparency we provide the electorate as to how everyone voted, the less fraud, but now opportunities for interpersonal conflict have increased.  How will it look at work if you vote in favor of much-hated legislation that regulates your industry? How will your friends and family feel if you vote in favor of legislation that runs counter to your shared system of beliefs?</p>

<p>At this point, it must be admitted that there is no perfect solution to this problem. We are living with it right now, in fact, and we have an imperfect solution that has been working well enough that it seldom if ever becomes a real problem.  That is, your party affiliation is a matter of public record.</p>

<p>When you register to vote you can declare a party affiliation.  You don’t have to, but for many primary elections, you need to be registered as a member of the party in question before you can vote. That party affiliation is information stored at your registrar of voters who is obligated to provide third parties with lists of voters which they can use for various purposes.  Now, different registrars obey different rules when it comes to divulging the information in their database.  But if they are too tight with the information–or too loose–they may find themselves on the wrong end of a lawsuit.</p>

<p>This means, technically speaking, if I run a large corporation, say, and I hate anyone and everyone in one political party, and love everyone and anyone in some other political party, I could conceivably manage to get a hold of the records of every one of my employees, and fire everyone who was registered to the wrong party.</p>

<p>Of course, I would be opening myself up to a massive, class-action lawsuit on the basis of wrongful termination.  So, I could be a bit more clever about it.  I could find out the registered party affiliation of every job applicant, and hire only the ones who belong to my preferred party.</p>

<p>Again, though, I am still vulnerable to legal trouble. In order to get the information from the registrar, I have to explain what use I intend to put it to.  I can’t get information from the registrar if I list, as a reason for wanting it, “so I can engage in discriminatory hiring practices.” So, while these sorts of shenanigans are possible, we are not aware of anyone undertaking them with any frequency.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion, much can be done to prevent your spouse or your employer from knowing how you voted. We could start, for instance, with your voter registration number.  This is issued by the registrar of voters and is associated with your name.  We mentioned before that the list of every voter and how they voted must be freely available as raw data in order to avert certain kinds of fraud. But, by using your voter registration number, which, presumably, only you know, we can limit the ability of others to monitor your voting behavior. Your registrar of voters, naturally, knows who you are and what your number is, but they are circumscribed by law when it comes to divulging that information.</p>

<p>No system can eliminate every possibility of fraud. But a system can, in fact, be designed that limits the possibility of fraud to such a great extent that the outcome of the vote will seldom, if ever, be effected by it. Likewise, no system can ever ensure 100% privacy, especially where people are willing to break the law in order to invade your privacy. But, again, a system can be designed to limit that sort of intrusion down to a bare minimum. Designing and maintain such a system is simply a matter of vigilance.</p>

<p>[something about making vigilance achievable, not just an onerous burden on the individual.]</p>

<p>And, of course, the system you are joining when you join the DSUp Project seeks to effectuate both of those outcomes: eliminating the possibility of fraud, and protecting privacy, the the greatest extent possible under the circumstances.  And, once again, you don’t have to join the DSUp Project in order to start a direct legislature in your district (though we hope you do!), and, having joined the DSUp Project in the beginning stages of the development of your DSUL, you don’t need to remain a participant in the DSUp Project in order to continue enjoying direct legislation.</p>

<p>That said, you see why it is important to have mechanisms in place to ensure the accuracy of the vote when you start your DSUL, and why we have put so much advance work into creating those mechanisms so that you can get your DSUL up and running with a minimum of chaos and confusion.</p>

<h3 id="your-districts-direct-legislature-is-not-exactlylegal">Your District’s Direct Legislature is Not Exactly…Legal</h3>

<p>This may seem a bit shocking at first.</p>

<p>It would seem obvious that if all the eligible voters gather together in a district, and decide to create a direct legislature, and if they then come up with a majority decision for or against a particular bill, that vote should have some sort of legal impact.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t. It can’t.  And more importantly–you don’t want it to.</p>

<p>Remember that the DSUp version of direct legislation exploits a loophole in how representative democracy works.  Because representatives must be, at least in theory, independent of any consideration other than their own constituents, there is no legal way to circumscribe how any given legislator votes–as long as they are not guilty of taking a bribe to sway their vote, of course.  Otherwise, they are free to follow opinion polls, lets say, and vote with the majority, or defy the majority opinion to do what they feel is in the best interests of the constituents.  Or they could flip a coin. No one can say boo.</p>

<p>So, while a direct legislature is not an opinion poll, it is only a direct reflection of the well-considered, well-articulated will of the people–which is to say, waaaaaay better than an opinion poll.  And, while it is true that your representative, provided they have been elected by DSUL voters, is morally and ethically committed to voting in line with the will of the DSUL, and will suffer their wrath if they don’t, the representative is still legally able to vote however they wish.  The only recourse for a DSUL representative who, after been elected represent the DSUL, fails to do so is to be voted out of office in the next election. Bear in mind, however, that a DSUL elected representative is a product of the direct legislature, a member and long-standing participant, who meets regularly with the Delegation to the Representative, a group of about ten people each of which represents a tenth of the DSUL’s participants, and all of which are strong candidates to take over the job of representative should the representative fail in their ‘sworn’ duty to the DSUL.</p>

<p>That still leaves us, though, with a district legislature that, while it functions happily within the law, is not regulated by any specific set of laws, and it not an organ of government.  And this is the way you want it to be–trust us!  We don’t want to have to get laws passed in existing legislatures in order to create a new system of legislatures–that would be madness and folly.  We don’t want disputes in the DSUL winding up in the court system.  More madness.  More folly.  We want, above all else, for every one of the 435 DSULs in the United States to be autonomous, self-regulating, and free from outside forces both public and private. Any problems the DSUL runs into must be solved by the DSUL itself. Imagine what happens if existing legislatures pass laws regulating what your DSUL can and cannot do?  You see what we mean now?  You really don’t want that.</p>

<h3 id="fear-mongering-and-the-vote">Fear-mongering and the Vote</h3>

<p>Be suspicious of anyone who attacks the idea of direct legislation on the basis that, with so many votes being tallied, the door to massive voting fraud must necessarily be open. Or that if the representative in congress isn’t legally obliged to vote with the voters, there is no point having a direct legislature. On both these issues, there are specific problems in specific contexts that can and should be addressed.</p>

<p>[This brings up an interesting issue.  We offer all this for free.  For free?  Will we ever want to charge?  If we are sponsored by donations, is there the possibility of undue influence?  If we suddenly switch to a fee-based service, aren’t we pulling a fast one? But isn’t the model where a DSUL pays for its own security the best way to ward off undue influence?]</p>
