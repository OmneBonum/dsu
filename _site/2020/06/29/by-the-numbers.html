      <p>Do you know how many people are in your federal congressional district?  Most people don’t.  Clever people, when asked this question, if they don’t know the answer off the top of their head, will start dividing.</p>

<p>Total population of the US divided by number of representatives in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Of course, the districts were last apportioned according to the most recent census, in 2010. They are about to be redrawn after the results of the 2020 census are tabulated. But back in 2010, the US population was about 309 million. The number of representatives in the House of Representatives has been fixed at 435 since 1929, when the average size for a congressional district was about 250,000. (Contrast this with the first congress where each representative served only about 35,000 people.) Of course, since 1929, the population has grown while the number of seats in congress has remained fixed. As of the reapportionment of 2013, each district had a population of 710,000.</p>

<p>309 million divided by 435 is about 710,000.</p>

<p>The beauty of our system of DSULs is that we don’t have to worry about how these groups of 710,000 were divided up geographically.  We can immunize ourselves to the effects of gerrymandering.  And we don’t have to limit ourselves to one person representing 710,000 people all at once–we can create a new tier of representation that brings us closer to the numbers for the first congress, and using tiers again to make representation even better–that is, more representative–than it was back then.</p>

<p>Before we go any further, though, make sure you’ve read ‘Who is in my DSUL?’</p>
