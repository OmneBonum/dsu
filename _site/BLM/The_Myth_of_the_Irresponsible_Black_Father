Conservatives tout 'family values.' This is actually sloganeering from the right
which concocted this ultimately perverse mandate in reaction to phenomena like
single-parent families in the black community.

The notion of family values is perverse on the face of it because many, many families
are a nightmare. [kids don't need mother and father but adequate caregiving
environment?]

A black man is, perhaps, already non-plussed by his condition as a male member
of a societal sub-caste.  Remaining in a domestic partnership becomes untenable.
