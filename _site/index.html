  <h1 class="callout-title">The Democracy Straight-Up! Story</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
This blog is for sharing my thoughts about the Democracy Straight-Up! project
as it unfolds. The project will enable US voters nation-wide to vote directly
on legislation before the US House of Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
The idea is simply called <em>direct legislation</em>.  We view the exercise of
this kind of direct voting
not as an optional <em>tweak</em>, but as a fundamental right that has been
over-looked for too long. The reality is, laws inevitably affect freedom. Every
individual in a democracy gives up some freedom--and gains a great deal of
benefit, hopefully--when laws are enacts.  Consequently, every individual
must have a meaningful opportunity to weigh in on every law.
    </p>
    <h3>Fear Not</h3>
    <p>
      Direct legislation is not a new idea, and, to be sure, there has been a great
      deal of fear and misunderstanding around it whenever its implementation has been
      proposed.  We'll try to allay any fears in advance by emphasizing what the
      DSUp Project <em>is not</em>: it does not propose legislation through referenda,
      direct democracy, or that every citizen must become an expert on every issue.
      It does not propose any changes to existing law or the constitution. The
      project has no political orientation--it is meant for every American
      voter, regardless of political affiliation.

    <p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>

<h2>THE FOUNDERS</h2>
<p>
  Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl,
  Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin.  We believe that the kind of technical
  sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least
  a billion people, probably more.

        Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
        Michael is the creator of the
        <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
        Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
        introductory sequence.

        Michael is also notorious as the founder of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
        Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder

        designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of
        the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on
        Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a
        true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines
        of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
