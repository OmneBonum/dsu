<h8 style="font-weight: 900; line-height: normal;">Donating to The Democracy Straight-Up
  Project really is a smart thing to do. Soon the causes you've always supported
  will receive a huge boost of energy, once Direct
  Legislation and Direct Representation are in place nationwide. And being a part
  of The Direct Revolution will be satisfying. You can watch (and maybe even help out)
  as we undertake, and successfully complete, our moonshot to strengthen American democracy for the benefit
  of generations to come.
