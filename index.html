      <p>Have you ever wondered if there were a better system of government than
        democracy?  Maybe a benevolent monarch would be the ticket. Or a strong
        dictator (who, of course, agrees with your personal politics). What say we
        abolish private property and set up a communist state controlled by the
        vanguard of the proletariate! Better yet, we could settle on one relgion, and let the leaders
        of it order us around whether we like it or not. Yay! How about that?
</p><p>
        Wait a minute. It seems like all of those ideas have been tried out before. And they really
        didn't work very well.
</p><p>
        Turns out, there is a better system than democracy, namely, a better democracy.
        Direct Legislation combined with a merit-based system of delegation called Direct
        Representation that provides us with the fundamental underpinnings
        of good self-government that have, unfortunately, been missing all along.
        The Democracy Straight-Up Project is setting up something called a District
        Direct Legislature in all 435 US Congressional
        Districts.  We call them DDL's for short. The majority vote of each DDL will
        determine the vote an elected House Rep casts on the floor of the US House.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are confident that there are enough Americans out there who will embrace
        this project to get the ball rolling, build momentum, and finally achieve
        our goal--which, after all, once you read about it, might be your goal too.

            Don is the Founder and Director of the project. He is an insightful
            and penetrating thinker, who has done a deep dive into the roots of
            dysfunction in American democracy, and has come up with a bold strategy
            to fix it. He has a clear vision of what needs to be accomplished
            through The Democracy Straight-Up Project, and an unstoppable drive
            to achieve it. Among his many talents, he is skilled at writing the
            biographical text that appears below his own picture on the DSUp Project
            website. Winky face.
