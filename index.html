  <h1 class="callout-title">A Blog About the Democracy Straight-Up! Project</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
This blog is a means to kick off the Democracy Straight-Up! Project.
The project will enable US voters nation-wide to vote directly
on legislation brought before the US House of Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
The idea is called <em>direct legislation</em>. We view as fundamental the right
 to shape
legislation, deliberate and discuss it, and, ultimately, to have an equal and
effective vote on its passage into law.
This right is fundamental in the same way as freedom of speech,
universal sufferage, privacy rights, civil rights, and whatever your favorite
amendment is in the bill of rights.

The argument in favor of direct legislation is fairly straight-forward, and can
be summed up in the phrase "My Freedom, My Vote."
    </p>
    <h5>Fear Not</h5>
    <p>
      Direct legislation is not a new idea, and, to be sure, there has been a great
      deal of fear and misunderstanding around it whenever its implementation has been
      proposed.  We'll try to allay any fears in advance by emphasizing what the
      DSUp Project <em>is not</em>: it does not propose legislation through referenda,
      direct democracy, or that every citizen must become an expert on every issue.
      It does not propose any changes to existing law or the constitution. The
      project has no political orientation--it is meant for every American
      voter, regardless of political affiliation.
