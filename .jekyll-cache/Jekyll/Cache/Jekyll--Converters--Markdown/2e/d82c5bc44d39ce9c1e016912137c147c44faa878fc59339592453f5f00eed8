<p>In this draft text, I vacillate between â€˜Iâ€™ and â€˜we.â€™ Eventually, we need to consistently use â€˜we.â€™ I will use â€˜Iâ€™ here because this is not text that will be part of the final site.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t use, say, a literary reference where plain language will do the trick.  For instance, I want to write, â€œDepending on the influence they wield, some peopleâ€™s vote is, in essence, larger than others.â€  But this reminds me of <ins>Animal Farm</ins> by George Orwell.</p>
