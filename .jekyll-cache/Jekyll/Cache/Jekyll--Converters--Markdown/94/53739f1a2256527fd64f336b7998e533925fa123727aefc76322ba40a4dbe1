I"a6<p>There are all sorts of other projects out there centering on the issue of democratic participation, and we find all of them come up short.</p>

<p>This make sense.  We wouldn’t want to waste time reduplicating what others have already done, and that which is already established.  We would simply join with them and put our energies into making their project work.</p>

<p>The creation of DSUp started with a long process of trying to find such an organization or movement.  But we just couldn’t find anyone out there who got it right.</p>

<p>The approach taken by this site is typical–and typically ineffective: <a href="http://forums.e-democracy.org/">Link</a></p>

<p>There is one overarching criticism that seems to be true for every democracy-oriented project out there.</p>

<p>They urge voters to increase their involvement without offering any increase in power.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important point. It is worth stopping and really letting it sink in.</p>

<p>The DSUp Project starts with the promise that “You will have a direct, binding, effective, real-life vote on every bill that comes before congress.”</p>

<p>Yes, it may only be one vote out of 500,000, if we are looking at your district alone. Or one vote out of 200 million, if we look at the entirety of the United States. So it could be argued that this one vote thing is rather paltry.</p>

<p>But consider this–right now, you have LESS THAN ONE VOTE.</p>

<p>It is the inevitable effect of the current system that people with the money and the means have greater influence on how a representative votes, and therefor have, in effect, a bigger vote.  [more here]</p>

<p>Many projects talk about ‘giving citizens a voice’ and ‘promoting inclusiveness.’</p>

<p>It may surprise you to learn that the DSUp Project does not aim to do either of these things.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>You already have a voice. You can stand on the street corner and spout your opinions till the cows come home, if you like. You can start your own newsletter–Gutenburg would be green with envy at what your desktop printer can do.  You can start your own website (like we did!) or post on any number of on-line forums, many of which are completely uncensored. And, every once in a while at least, politicians hold events where you can show up in person and yell at them.</p>

<p>You already have a voice.  What you do not have is a vote.</p>

<p>Now, will having a vote change how you use your voice?  Probably.  Will membership in a DSUL give you a better forum in which to use your voice?  That’s the goal!</p>

<p>The point is, right now you have a voice, but for most people, using it is a frustrating and fruitless experience. It is yelling into the wind.  The fact is, you can speak all you like, but unless you have some sort of power over other people, no one has to listen to you!</p>

<p>This is the current system, where people with some kind of power have a bigger vote.  Let’s be clear–no one is to blame for this, it is just the way things work when you don’t have a direct legislature.  We just need to fix this one aspect of the system, and it won’t be a problem any more.</p>

<p>Neither do we aim to “promote inclusiveness”.</p>

<p>Sounds crazy for a project like this to say that, right?  Well, it is certainly not that we are against inclusiveness, we just don’t see the need to put any extra effort into promoting it.  Since anyone can join their DSUL, and since it is sufficiently easy to do, the inclusiveness issue will take care of itself.  At the same time, everyone is free to not join if they choose.  Nothing about the DSUp Project deprives citizens of the rights they already enjoy.  You can still vote in all the same elections you always did.  You still have the right to free speech and all the other rights that you’ve always had.  If you don’t want to participate in the direct legislature, that’s your choice.  We’ve made it as easy as humanly possible to join, but if you still don’t want to join, that’s up to you!  And we support you in your decision.</p>

<p>It’s just that, if you take that position, then, when laws are enacted or repealed, and you want to complain about it, you will sound quite silly.  Obviously, if you felt that way about an issue, you should have joined the direct legislature in your district, and said something, and voted.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn’t guarantee that the vote will go your way.  But it does guarantee that when the vote doesn’t go your way, you get to complain about the stupid majority and their stupid decision. And, through the DSUL, you can tell them how stupid they are to their big fat faces. And if you somehow win enough voters over to your side, and get them all to vote a certain way, you may be able to reverse that decision.</p>

<p>Of course, from a practical perspective, derision and mockery may not be the best tools of persuasion. But you are free to use them if you choose, we won’t stop you.</p>

<p>On a related point, the DSUp Project does not encourage people to be ‘less divisive.’ We are not here to promote ‘unity,’ at least not beyond the basics: you must ‘unite’ to form a direct legislature, and you must ‘unite’ to go to the polls and vote for the person who your DSUL chose as its representative in congress.  It is the same, in principle, as it was at the founding of the nation when we all had to ‘unite’ behind the creation of a government and the constitution.  But, after that act of unity, we were free to go at each other as divisively as we wished.</p>

<p>As a small digression, we’d like to share that an early incarnation of this project was called, “The Civil Democracy Project.” We liked the word ‘civil’ because it implies ‘civic’ participation, which is to say, the involvement of the people rather than just the ‘higher ups’.  But it also implies ‘civility,’ which has to do with treating each other with respect.</p>

<p>But then we realized we were being stinky. We were telling people how to behave and what ideas their behavior should embody. It may be someone’s personal goal to be as respectful as possible, even to people whose point of view they find repugnant, even to people who are disrespectful towards them.  But who are we to try to enforce that goal on everyone?  Is there no role for disrespect?  Even when some group touts a philosophy that is almost universally regarded as deeply abhorrent?</p>

<p>The upshot is, we are not trying to advocate for any particular mode of behavior once you’ve established your direct legislature and it is up and running.  Yes, your DSUL has to have rules of conduct, and people have to follow those rules, and there has to be a mechanism to address circumstances where members don’t follow them. We want to help with these logistics. But we will not try to enforce any particular code of conduct when operating within this basic set of rules.</p>

<p>Another related point: the DSUp Project is not bi-partisan. It is non-partisan but it is also all-partisan.</p>

<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>Being bi-partisan means, specifically, there there are two major parties in a republic (such as ours), one party should not force legislation through without the participation of the other party. They should work together to come up with some they can both agree on. This is fine.  We’re all for it.  But can we say that there is never a time when it would be appropriate for a simple majority to force through legislation, turning a deaf ear to the protests of the minority?  No, we can’t say that.  So we leave the question to you to answer.</p>

<p>Being non-partisan simply means that we don’t distinguish between participants based on party affiliation, political ideology, positions on issues, etc. This is easy for us to do, actually, for two reasons: one, direct legislation is a fundamental right, and therefor, it applies to everyone regardless of what they believe.  Two, the DSUL is open to participation by everyone in the district–there is no way to keep anybody out.  So even if we tried to be sneaky, even if we purposely designed all of our outreach to encourage more participation from members of one party over the other, and even if that dastardly scheme worked, it wouldn’t work for long.  Eventually, the people in the opposing party who we tried to leave out would simply join!  Of course, we would never try to do that and we really don’t want to, but it is good to know it would be useless for us to try.</p>

<p>Now, we like to go a step further than non-partisan and say that we are all-partisan. That is, whatever your partisan affiliation, once you join a DSUL, you will be able to express yourself fully and freely without any sort of politically-correct shaming from the project itself. To be clear, this does not apply to actions that directly effect the integrity of the vote [link]. The vote is, of course, sacrosanct.  But other than that, let your freak flag fly.</p>

<p>This is perhaps putting too fine a point on it, but the problem with many democracy-oriented projects is that they seem to appeal, on their face, to one political persuasion or the other.  For instance, we you start talking about ‘being inclusive’ you are automatically singling out a particular political philosophy that is often accused–rightly or wrongly–of being un-inclusive. When your democracy project pounds the table in favor of ‘defending our rights and freedoms’ you are casting some shade on a party that may have the reputation–rightly or wrongly–of not defending certain ‘rights and freedoms’. Of course we think inclusiveness and defense of rights are both good things. But we aren’t going to make any phrase like that into a motto to write on our standard.</p>

<p>Is Direct Legislation inherently favorable to some political ideology?</p>

<p>This is an interesting question. To answer it, we have to look at how political ideologies come into being.</p>

<p>Clearly there are, in a general sense, two major political ideologies in the United States that are pitted against one another (at least from time to time.) But those two, seemingly opposing, points-of-view did not rise up, sui -generis, from the waters beneath the earth.  They evolved with in a social context, a context greatly shaped by the current form of democracy we practice.</p>

<p>That is to say, we have the political parties we have today, to some extent, because we have not had a system of direct legislation. The need to coalesce around an ideological position may be more a symptom of the ineptness and inefficiency engendered by a representative system that does not incorporate direct legislation, rather than an unavoidable aspect of human nature.  To increase our personal power, we must join a party, and when we do so, we must sign-off on an entire party platform rather than making decisions issue by issue. Certainly, it is possible to say, “I belong to (a given) political party, but unlike most people in that party, I do not agree with (a given issue).” But that does you little good. Because when you vote for a candidate from that party, they will most likely vote against your position on that particular issue.</p>

<p>So, it is hard to say that direct legislation is inherently politically ideological, since the political positions we currently know and love to hate will take on a different character once direct legislation is the norm.</p>

<p>This is one of those things that is simply impossible to predict–though many will try to do so. Heck, we are predicting that democracy will be better in all sorts of ways under a system of direct legislation.  But what if we are wrong?  What if we are just making things way, way worse?  Gulp!</p>

<p>This is why we warn people not to look at direct legislation solely in terms of the possible future benefit it may offer. This is simply the wrong way to look at it.</p>

<p>The right way to look at it is, direct legislation is a fundamental right, one that has been neglected up until now; we are merely finding a way to finally exercise that right.  Making it actually work is sort of a separate issue. Trying to predict long-term and short-term outcomes is fun, and even useful, but the path forward is not dictated by those prospective outcomes.  The path forward is dictated by–once again–the exercise of that fundamental right that we all have to direct legislation.</p>

<p>That being said, most predictions made at this point are likely to be wrong.  That is just the nature of the beast.  We are trying to do something that has never been done in human history.  There is nothing to compare it to.  Predictions must rely on an assessment of the past.  “In the past, when this has happened, such and such has tended to follow.” But you can’t really know what will happen next, following in the aftermath of something that has never been done before.  Especially in the context of something that takes place on such a huge stage and effects an entire country.</p>

<p>Despite all that, we have every reason to be optimistic.  No one really knew what would happen after the founding of the United States.  In fact, many people opined that it would all fall apart and revert back to monarchy before you knew it. But it didn’t.  Our screwed-up, imperfect democracy did not die, and lived to become much less screwed-up and a lot less imperfect.</p>

<p>So, whatever happens after direct legislation, lets remember: our democracy will not die. There is good reason to make dire predictions–namely, so that we can take action to avert those outcomes.  Rosy predictions may not pan out, so lets not pin all our hopes on them.  And though it has been said many times before, we say it again here: the best way to predict the future is to create it.</p>
