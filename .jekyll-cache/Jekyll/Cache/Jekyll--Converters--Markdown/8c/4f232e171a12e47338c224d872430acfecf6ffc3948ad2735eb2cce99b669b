I"»<p>As you may have read elsewhere, joining your districtâ€™s direct legislature entails joining a small group of six to twelve other voters and electing a delegate from among your number to be a first tier delegate. This minimum requirement means that pretty much every citizen that wants to participate can do so. It can be as easy as a friend calling you up and saying, â€œHey, we have five people counting me.  Want to be the sixth?â€</p>
