I"â<p>The DSUp Project extolls an immutable principle: that every citizen has the right to vote directly on legislation. It is not simply that direct legislation is so much better than the current system of legislation by representation.  It is, but that is that is not the only underlying rationale.  It is certainly not true that direct legislation will be easier. It will be harder. Doable, worth it, but harder, especially at first. Direct legislation is not the path to a more certain future, to social tranquility, to an enlightened society, or what have. We hope all these things come to pass, we do in fact think that DSUp Project will help get us there, but again, this is not the reason we must all embrace direct legislation.</p>
