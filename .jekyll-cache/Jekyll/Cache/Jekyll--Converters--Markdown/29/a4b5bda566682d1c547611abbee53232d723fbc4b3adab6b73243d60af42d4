I"Õ<p>The basis of DSUp is face-to-face, in-person communication. However, this does not mean that all, or even the majority, of the communication youâ€™ll be involved in as a participant in the process of direct legislation will be in person.  Of course we should make use of telephones and computers and everything in between. Not to mention snail-mail, which still has its place, and, if you insist, fax machines and the like.</p>

<p>But, as you will see, the fundamental unit of organization in DSUp is a small group of people, small enough to fit in your living room, who all know each other.</p>

<p>This is not an arbitrary or optional criteria.  Without this unit of organization, direct legislation will not work.</p>
