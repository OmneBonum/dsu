I"ê<p>The Democracy Straight-Up! Project seeks to establish a system of direct legislatures in all 435 federal congressional districts in the United States‚Äìhopefully before the 2022 mid-term elections.</p>

<p>What you are reading here is a very, very rough draft in progress.  Send feedback to omnebonumest@gmail.com.</p>

<p>Right now I am focussed on the explanation and description. This makes sense to the extent that ironing out the details of what the project is about will effect the form it takes, and, inevitably, the shape of the site.</p>

<p>But really, the site should be up-and-running as soon as possible, even while the details of the project are being sorted out. That means creating a site where American voters can go and sign up for the district legislature in the district where they live and start voting immediately.  Of course, this vote won‚Äôt be fully effective until they have a representative in congress that has been put on the ballot and elected into office by their direct legislature. So the site will need to take people through that process‚Äìwhich is a one-time thing‚Äìof going from just a few people to the 100,000 or more that are likely to be needed to get their direct legislature to the point where it is ‚Äòlive.‚Äô</p>

<p>To be clear, ‚Äòlive‚Äô means the member of congress for a given district represents the direct legislature for that district and votes with the majority on an issue-by-issue basis.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm working on designing the website where people can sign-up and vote, but I could use help on that task, if anyone wants to pitch in.</p>

<h3 id="not-really-a-blog">Not Really a Blog</h3>

<p>You may notice that this is not really a blog.  The posts are undated.  I‚Äôm just using the blog format to post a series of essays on topics supporting the fundamental logic and the scope of operations of the project. I will be continually updating and revising these posts.  The struggle here is there are about six different aspects of the project that all need to be understood at the same time to really get to the point where you go, ‚ÄúI see!‚Äù</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The framing of direct legislation as a fundamental right</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working within the legacy of the existing system</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Starting at the federal level and all at once</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The unavoidable inevitability of a tiered system of delegation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not trying to change people. Accommodating human nature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensuring the accuracy of the vote</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proportional voting in congressional elections.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Softer targets, i.e., what the project will support aside from a voting system</p>

<p>Fact-based policy decisions</p>

<p>Changing the internal structure of your own district legislature</p>

<p>Creating issue-based work groups</p>

<p>Providing tools for authoring and revising legislation</p>
