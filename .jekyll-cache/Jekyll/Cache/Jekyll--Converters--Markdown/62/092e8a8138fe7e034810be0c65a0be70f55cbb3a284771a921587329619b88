I"5P<p>With the caveat that this is not a situation that lends itself to accurate predictions [insert a link], there are some problems that really should be ameliorated greatly, if not solved entirely.</p>

<p>Of course, we wouldn’t be embarking on this project if we didn’t think it was going to make things much better, in many ways, for all Americans.</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-of-campaign-finance">The Problem of Campaign Finance</h3>

<p>Wherever a DSUp legislature is set up, both of these problems are solved.</p>

<p>This is because of the system of tiered delegation.  Each group appoints a delegate from among their number to represent them in all matters before the DSUL. One beauty of this is that you are never more than a few steps away from your member of congress, and information can flow back and forth between you. But another beauty is that no one ‘runs for office’ in the traditional sense. The tiers of representation create a kind of a sieve, if you will. The best and the brightest, at each tier of delegation, are shaken out and fall into the next one, where, once again, the best of the best make their way to the next tier. Each delegate is elected by their peers to the next tier of the DSUL.  And ‘the best of the best’ is subjective.  One tranche of your D-Leg might elevate an individual that you personally think is an idiot.  That’s just the way it is. That’s human nature.  The DSUp project is not trying to <a href="/2020/06/30/changing-human-nature.html">change human nature</a></p>

<p>Let’s dig down into what this ‘sieve’ effect will do.  It will never be the case that a certain political party says to the constituency at large, through some sort of mass media campaign, “This is the one!  If you are a member of our party, vote for this one!” If a small group of people with a lot of money get together and say, “We want this person!” they have a difficult task ahead of them that doesn’t involve how they spend their money.  Whoever they ‘like’ has to join the DSUL and then make their way through the process of delegation to the tier closest to the representative, and then be nominated by that group to become the next candidate on the ballot in the regular election to office.</p>

<p>That means that one entire tranche–that is, from 5 to 10% of all the voters participating in the DSUL in their district–must approve of a candidate before they are even eligible to be nominated.  And the process of nomination is matter of winning a majority vote from the entire DSUL.</p>

<p>And, once elected to office, the DSUL rep from your district will be voting with the majority of the DSUL on a bill by bill basis.  Now, it may be that each vote falls in line with a particular party platform–but that is only if the majority of a given district so happens to always embrace the position of one given party.  That’s as may be.  But ‘the majority’ does not always have to be the same group of people, and in practice, certainly won’t be. ‘The majority’ on one piece of legislation might be a somewhat, or even very different group of people than the majority vote on some other piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Now, the delegate that makes it to the very end of the tranche may be a die-hard member of some party–there is nothing to stop that. But to get elected to office (that is, to be nominated by the DSUL to stand for office), that party loyalty has to be a generally attractive quality to the voters.  Even then, once in office, the DSUL rep is committed to voting with the majority, even if that decision runs counter to the wishes of the party. And if DSUL rep were to vote against the majority of their own district–which they could do if they wanted to–they would be doing so at their own peril.</p>

<p>The DSUL provides us with a forum that is a pure meritocracy, in which there is no need of any individual to ‘campaign’ throughout an entire district.  The DSUL has the nomination process baked into it, and the means by which constituents at large are informed about who’s in the running are also baked in. Once the DSUL decides who to put on the ballot, by a majority vote, everyone in the DSUL agrees to vote for that person.  Of course, they could go to the polls and vote for someone else, but what would be the point?</p>

<p>This means that a very qualified person can be elected to office who doesn’t need to pledge allegiance to any given party, and who doesn’t need to spend a dime to get there.  Campaign finance reform–solved!</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-of-term-limits">The Problem of Term Limits</h3>

<p>Term limits have always been a contentious issue.  The underlying phenomenon is that once someone is elected to congress, they tend to get re-elected and re-elected until the voters are basically rubber-stamping the same person into office over and over again.  This process seems to have little relation to how well the representative is doing their job, even.  Unless they really screw up, their job is basically guaranteed.  People who fund campaigns like an incumbent because their chances are good, so the incumbent gets the financing they need to get the word out.  Sometimes the demographics of a district change, and the opposing party can oust a long-serving representative.  But this is uncommon enough that both parties find themselves frustrated by the current state of affairs. Worse yet, when the outcome of an election seems too inevitable to fight, parties stop even bothering to run serious candidates, and the incumbent runs unopposed.  This, of course, greatly depresses civic involvement and voter turnout.  And it is just plain depressing.</p>

<p>So, in theory, term limits should be somewhat appealing to both parties. But as much talk as there is about it, congress has never put together enough votes for any specific plan on the matter.</p>

<p>Of course, the DSUp Project itself takes no position on the imposition of term limits.  But we would like to point out that the creation of a DSUL will have a healthy effect on the underlying infirmities that make term limits a tempting remedy.</p>

<p>That is to say, this process of rubber-stamping the incumbent is a phenomenon driven larger by low participation levels among voters. The fact that the base is so disconnected from their rep leads to a lot of behaviors driven by fear and a desire to play it safe. For instance, if someone from a given party is already in office, and you are a member of that party, are you really going to take a chance voting on another candidate, even within the same party?  Even if you think that new candidate is much more qualified? The bottom line is, you don’t want the other guys to get the seat.  So you play it safe.</p>

<p>Your DSUL will help remedy this problem by bringing each constituent closer to their representative, in terms of tracking their performance in particular. The DSUL will also reduce the importance of party loyalty, since anyone in the seat will be voting with the majority no matter the party.  So, some of the problems that term limits are meant to address won’t be as problematic any more.</p>

<p>And let’s remember: there’s nothing wrong with electing the same person over and over again, provided that person really is qualified to do the job, and as long as the majority of the voters in a district really do want them in office.</p>

<h3 id="campaigning-and-fundraising-the-great-time-suck">Campaigning and fundraising: The Great Time Suck</h3>

<p>Members of congress are constantly complaining about how much time they have to spend on the phone soliciting campaign contributions.  We’ve heard that the average congressperson spends about 50% of their working hours engaged in such activity.  And during that time, they are not listening to or advocating for you, the constituent.  They are interacting with a select group of people, inside and outside the district, who’s unifying feature is they have access to money and are willing to spend it on the right candidate.</p>

<p>It’s a deplorable system and everyone, mostly, hates it.  But it is regarded as unavoidable.</p>

<p>But after your DSUL is up and running, your representative will not have to spend any time whatsoever campaigning for office, and they will need to solicit exactly zero campaign contributions.  They will be available full-time to do the job they were elected to do. They will be re-elected based on their performance–and the people voting for the rep, the members of DSUL, will be well-informed as to exactly what that performance has been.</p>

<h3 id="off-year-elections-bringing-rain-to-the-desert">Off-year Elections: Bringing Rain to the Desert</h3>

<p>Off-year elections are the years where congresspeople are up for re-election, but there is nothing ‘sexy’ on the ballot, like a president or a maybe a senator. In many districts, fewer than 10% of eligible voters even bother to vote.  It’s a deplorable situation that no one is happy with, and until now, there has never been a solution. This is something a DSUp legislature will handle much better. If your DSUL doesn’t get enough people to the polls to re-elect its DSUL-friendly representative, it puts itself in a bad situation for the next two years. We trust that rational self-interest will prevent this from happening very often.  And if it does happen to a particular district–profound lesson learned.</p>

<p>Of course, this is only the case once the DSUL has enough members to guarantee the election of their candidate to office.  In the ramp up to a fully-functioning direct legislature, the DSUL candidate may stand for election and lose.  This is going to be a necessary part of the process. But eventually, once your DSUL is large enough, the DSUL candidate will win the seat, and you’ll be good to go.</p>

<h3 id="gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</h3>

<p>Gerrymandering is the process of drawing up the boundaries of legislative districts so that more representatives from one party or the other are elected to congress than are actually voted for by the base.  Because district parties are drawn up every ten years, based on the census, by the party in power, that party always has the ability to ‘cheat’ the boundaries in their favor.  This creates a scenario where the majority of voters may vote for candidates of one party, but the majority of seats in congress are held by the other party.</p>

<p>This is an unacceptable situation, no matter what political party is lured to the dark side by this underhanded power grab.  In the US, both major parties have been guilty of the practice at different points in time.</p>

<p>The DSUp Project will be able to render gerrymandering ineffective, although this can’t happen until a majority of the House is made up of DSUL reps.</p>

<p>What is needed is a system of proportional voting.  That is, in order to represent the will of the people accurately, a rep won’t just vote ‘Yea’ ‘Nay’ or ‘Present’ (those are the current choices), in keeping with a ‘winner-takes all’ philosophy.  Rather, they will be able to mete out a proportion of their vote to each response.</p>

<p>Different scenarios for implementing this fix will be possible. Congress can vote to change its rules however it wants.  Of course, under no scenario can one congress person have more votes, or more of a vote than any other.  But it could, say, allow each member to divide their vote into fifths, and allow them to allocate each fraction of a vote as they see fit.  For the DSUL rep, this mean that if a district voted 60% yes, 20% no, and 20% undecided, they could allocate that vote into 3 “yeas,” 2 “Nays” and 1 “Present.” Effectively, this gives each representative 5 votes, but since they all have five votes, this preserves the requirement of equal representation, or proportional representation.</p>

<p>We actually like the number 10. We fix the size of the tier closest to the representative at 10, and it makes sense to honor that by giving each of those members, effectively, a tenth of the vote.</p>

<p>This means that the House, rather than tallying up 435 votes, would be tallying up 4350 votes. (Of course, this is an even number which allows for a tie. There are easy ways to address that situation, but we’ll kick that particular can down the road.)</p>

<p>Other divisions of the vote could be contemplated.  Mathematicians and statisticians will need to weight in on the issue.  The point is, there is a magic number, a subdivision of the vote, that will prevent it from ever being the case that the majority of Americans feel one way about a particular bill, but the majority of their representatives vote the other way.  This is the situation that has usually been the case in our democracy.  Its one of the things that makes people give up and check out of the process altogether.</p>

<h3 id="people-who-want-to-be-politicians">People who Want to be Politicians…</h3>

<p>It is a truism that, in generally, the type of person who seeks office is not the type of person you actually want in office.  The process of making speeches, tooting ones own horn, soliciting funds, etc., is a completely different skill-set from what goes on, day-to-day, in a legislative office.</p>

<p>Using the DSUL, you can put someone into your seat in congress because they will be good at the job they are there to do. Those who are turned off by the ‘political process’ no longer need to shy away from serving. You could actually look at someone and say, “That person is hardworking, level headed and full of integrity. I think they should be in congress,” and then actually get them into congress!</p>

<p>Of course, there are no guarantees and no one can predict what the constituents of any particular DSUL will choose to do in future. But that scenario, where the best person really does get the job, is given fresh hope by the existence of a direct legislature in your district.</p>

<h3 id="partisanship">Partisanship</h3>

<p>It is difficult to say exactly how</p>

<h3 id="electing-presidents-to-the-executive-so-they-can-legislate">Electing Presidents to the Executive so they can Legislate</h3>

<p>One of the very silly things Americans do is to elect presidents based on their promise to pass certain types of legislation.</p>

<p>Now, there are three branches of government–The Executive, The Judicial, and The Legislative branches.</p>

<p>The president’s job is executive–she/he <strong>executes</strong> the will of the people as expressed through the decisions made by the legislature.</p>

<p>To be sure, it is a big important job.  And it is in the nature of things that no legislature can provide a framework for the executive branch that is so detailed and specific, the president has no discretion when deciding how to act.  It is always inevitable that many decisions must be left to the executive, and that the president must have some scope for deciding what to do when new problems arise and conditions change.</p>

<p>But there’s one thing a president can never do, and that is, they can’t pass a new law!</p>

<p>Because we are so frustrated and maddened by our own legislature, we Americans have taken to seeing the president as the head of a political party, and tasked her/him with trying to force that party’s platform on the congress whether they like it or not.</p>

<p>To add insult to injury, we then routinely elect the opposing party to hold the majority of congress so that the president can’t actually get her/his legislative agenda passed anyway!</p>

<p>This perverse state of affairs ends when we make the legislative branch do what it is supposed to do–namely, <em>legislate</em>–and let the president do what she/he is supposed to do, namely <em>execute the will of the people.</em>  This is not to say that no president will ever again have a legislative agenda, or try to muster members of congress to deploy that agenda.  But it is to say we can stop electing presidents primarily to overcompensate for a legislature that isn’t articulating the will of the people.</p>

<h3 id="whiner-babies">Whiner Babies</h3>

<p>The current system of representation is dysfunctional enough that people feel it is perfectly reasonable to complain bitterly that all politicians are a bunch of idiots. At the same time such these complainers do nothing to participate in a solution to that problem.  Because there is no point.  Because there’s nothing you can do.  Because the system is broken beyond repair.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, they aren’t entirely wrong when they say this.</p>

<p>After a system of direct legislation is in place, such critiques will have nowhere to land.  You are free to not join your district’s DSUL, but then you have lost the right to complain.  If you do join your DSUL, and you don’t like the decisions that are being made at the national level, you can only complain that your fellow citizens are idiots, and that they make terrible decisions. The people are in charge now, so you can’t blame those who happen to be elected to congress.</p>

<p>It is hard to know in your heart that something is right, and to be surrounded by people who don’t get it.  It is understandable, in that situation, to be angry and frustrated.  But, this is an aspect of the human condition for which we can offer no remedy.  We can’t create a society where this will never happen, where every individual is always content with the decisions made by the group.</p>

<p>What we can do, however, is provide a venue through which all that anger and frustration can be productively channelled.  We can guarantee that if you have an argument to make you will have a chance to be heard–as good a chance as anyone else.  Whether or not you are heard will depend, of course, on the persuasiveness of your argument.  No use complaining that people are listening when the problem is really that your argument is unconvincing!  But to the extent that, in the past, even good arguments would be quashed by forces seemingly beyond anyone’s control, now every argument will at least get its day in court.  We can’t offer anything better than equality in this regard, every individual will still only be one voice in 200 million.  But in the past one individual actually had less than one voice, so this will be an improvement.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-judiciary-to-legislate">Using the Judiciary to Legislate</h3>

<p>This is a contentious issue, so we won’t dwell on it at length, seeking, as we do, to stay out of the fray when it comes to controversy that doesn’t relate to the essential features of direct legislation.  But higher courts are sometimes accused of ‘judicial activism.’ This occurs when a court interprets an old law in light of what they feel would be reflected in a new law on the same issue.  Opponents argue that courts should always interpret a law in the light of the intentions of the people who created it.  If the people want a new law that reflects new thinking on the issue, they are free to do so through the legislature.</p>

<p>The problem is, the legislature has been notoriously sluggish and unresponsive when it comes to providing the updated laws that reflect the updated will of the people.  So judges of good conscience may feel morally impelled to interpret a law as generously as possible, so that its implementation doesn’t become a burden on the population. In some cases, lives may even hang in the balance, so this is no small moral quandary.</p>

<p>Now, it is easy to blame the legislators themselves for dereliction of duty in this regard.  But the problem goes deeper than electing incompetent people to serve in congress.  The fact is, the constituents are often not well-informed on, or motivated by, the kinds of issues the high courts rule on.  Legislators are not receiving any clear direction from the people they represent.  It is their job to reflect the will of the people, but so often, the will of the people is vague, confused, unformed, and undecided.</p>

<p>It is our hope that the system of direct legislation which will be implemented through our project will help the people understand and come to grips with the higher-level problems that too often get lost in the confusion of a too dysfunctional system. And as a result, judges will feel less obligated to shore up the weaknesses of the legislature for the sake of the common good.</p>
