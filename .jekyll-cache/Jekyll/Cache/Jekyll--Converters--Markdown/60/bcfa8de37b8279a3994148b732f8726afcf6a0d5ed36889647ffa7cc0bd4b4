I"¯<p>The basis of DSUp is face-to-face, in-person communication. However, this does not mean that all, or even the majority, of the communication youâ€™ll be involved in as a participant in the process of direct legislation will be in person.  Of course we should make use of telephones and computers and everything in between. Not to mention snail-mail, which still has its place, and, if you insist, fax machines and the like.</p>
