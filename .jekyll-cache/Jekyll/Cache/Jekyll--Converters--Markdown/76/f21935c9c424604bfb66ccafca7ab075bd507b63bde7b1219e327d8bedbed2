I"M<p>You are going to be setting up a District Legislature.  It will start small. It is likely to remain small for quite a while.  And then, if all goes well, it will get really, really big in a short amount of time.</p>

<p>But how big is big?</p>

<p>Here, we’ll argue ‘from strength’ by citing the largest possible number that we can reasonably fathom for maximum participation, and then show how that number would be totally manageable under our system, even if we were off by 100% or more.</p>

<p>So, that maximum number for you DSUL is: 450,000 voters. Here’s how we got to that number.</p>

<p>The United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, each of which contained, as of the 2010 census, an average of 710,767 constituents.</p>

<p>(By the way, that number may go up by as much as 5 percent when the results of the 2020 census are tabulated and congress apportions districts among ‘the several states.’ But this has little effect on the discussion here. We can safely use the 2010 numbers until the official 2020 numbers come out.)</p>

<p>A constituent is any person living in a district–whether or not they have the right to vote.  The largest block of non-voting constituents is that jobless population of resource-draining trouble-makers we call children.  Well, legally speaking, we call them minors.  And we love them to bits, of course.</p>

<p>Reliably, the proportion of children in any given area hovers around one quarter.  So, a rough estimate of the number of adults in your district is 533,000.</p>

<p>But there are other considerations.  In some states, convicted felons cannot vote. Not all adults are citizens–legal permanent residents, known as ‘green card holders,’ cannot vote. And some adults in your district are living there, shall we say, without explicit permission.</p>

<p>Felons barred from voting, about 5 million
Legal Permanent Residents about 12.6 million
Unauthorized Immgrants about 10.8 million</p>

<p>For each of the above, the exact percentages vary somewhat by district, but we see no need to itemize each district in terms of eligible voters.  We’ve crunched the numbers and we are happy guesstimating that about 85% of the 533,000 adults in your district are eligible to vote. (Note that we use voter registration as the basis for membership in a given district’s DSUL, see “Who’s in my DSUL?” for more.)</p>

<p>Rounding to a convenient number, 85% of 533,000 is 450,000 voters.</p>

<p>This constitutes a maximum for the number of people that could possibly join your DSUL.</p>

<p>We think actual participation is certain to be lower. And that’s okay. But, as mentioned above, we will use this number to strengthen our argument that the numbers involved are perfectly manageable, even at the extreme.</p>
