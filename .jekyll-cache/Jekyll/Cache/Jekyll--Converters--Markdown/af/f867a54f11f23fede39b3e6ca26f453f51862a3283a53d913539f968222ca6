I"»<p>Human nature is a lot of things.  It can lead us to the heights of enlightenment.  It can lead us to the depths of stupidity.</p>

<p>In this case, in creating a direct legislature to make laws, what we find, is that human nature does not prompt many of us to exclaim, ‚ÄúOh, boy‚Äìgive me another hierarchical system to live under‚Äìthat sounds like fun!‚Äù</p>

<p>In fact, if you‚Äôve taken a look at [link], you may find a little voice calling out from deep within your soul, ‚ÄúNo, Let me go! I want to be free!‚Äù The whole thing may seem oppressive.</p>

<p>There is a good reason for this.  Human society is always, to some extent, oppressive. So, you are correct.</p>

<p>And so, we would like to quickly point out, the DSUp direct-legislation project will actually make society LESS oppressive, not more. That‚Äôs right‚Äìit will actually allow individuals more freedom, not less.</p>

<p>The reason for this is clear enough. Think about oppression.  It is certainly the case that in a system where one group of people gets to be in charge, and they get to do whatever they want to some other group of people‚Äìthat‚Äôs oppressive!  That‚Äôs feudalism, where the aristocracy lords it over the common people, where they live by a different set of laws, where the working class is dehumanized and lives in a constant state of humiliation and subjugation. (We sometimes forget how bad things used to be.  Re-read A Tale of Two Cities when you get a chance. Things used to be really, really bad.)</p>

<p>The whole point of democracy in general, and American democracy in particular, is to vanquish that kind of arbitrary oppression.  The kind that says ‚ÄúWe matter and you don‚Äôt,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe make the rules and you follow them without complaint‚Ä¶or else!‚Äù</p>

<p>And, in fact, this direct legislation project is yet another reapplication of that same core principle that has led the United States to abolish slavery and Jim Crow, enfranchise women, and listen to ‚Äòthe better angels of our nature‚Äô.  ]</p>

<p>[This belongs in My Freedom, My Vote.]</p>

<p>Here is the thing about democracy.  It does not, cannot, completely remove that feeling of being oppressed.  Why?  Because in order to function, a society must have some set of rules (anarchists disagree, but they are wrong.)  The only question is, are the rules reasonable.  Whatever the rules are, since they are decided upon by a majority vote, in respect to any given rule, there will always be a minority who find it ‚Äòoppressive.‚Äô Actually, it might be more annoying, inconvenient, cumbersome, etc., than full on ‚Äòoppressive.‚Äô But for the sake of advocating for the minority in such situation, let‚Äôs call it ‚Äòoppressive,‚Äô to some extent or other.</p>

<p>So, here we are: self-government is less oppressive than any other form of government. Self-government with direct legislation is less oppressive still.  The majority will still have the ability to pass laws that the minority does not like.  But there are mitigating factors that make this form of ‚Äòoppression‚Äô the best we can hope for.</p>

<p>For one thing, ‚Äòthe majority‚Äô is not one unchanging group of people. On an issue by issue basis, an individual may find themselves in one or the other camp.  This is why a system of direct legislation is an improvement on the style of representative democracy we currently deploy.  Or current system lends itself to party platforms, which encourage an all-or-nothing approach to legislation.  That is to say, even if I disagree with a position taken by my party, I may vote for representatives that advocate‚Äìand vote for bills based on‚Äìthat position because they also advocate for some family of position I do agree with.  Furthermore, it may be that my position on a given issue‚Äìwhich is at odds with my party‚Äôs position‚Äìis actually the position held by an actual majority of the American people.  It is just that some large chunk of that majority belongs to the party that doesn‚Äôt happen to be in power at the moment.  If we continue to examine this state of affairs, we see that that majority, with its large chunk of supporters all in one party, if it wishes to change the law on that one issue, must rally around the opposing party, and embrace all of its agenda, even on issues they where they disagree with the party!</p>

<p>This is an ‚Äòoppressive‚Äô form of majoritarianism that crops up when you don‚Äôt have direct democracy, which allows for voting issue by issue, rather than based on an entire platform. A nation-wide system of DSULs removes this form of oppression.  (Here, ‚Äòoppression‚Äô sneaks in in the form of the arbitrary, anti-majoritarian passage of legislation.)</p>

<p>There will always be those who fear the ‚Äòtyranny of the majority.‚Äô It should comfort such people that our system already has checks and balances in place to mitigate the effects of that phenomenon.  Still, it is quite true that majoritarianism does allow for injustices to be heaped on the minority.  And despite our long-standing self-consciousness as a nation of the dangers of the ‚Äòtyranny of the majority,‚Äô there are ample examples from our history where the rule of law did just that.  Slavery.  Jim Crow.  Women‚Äôs Rights. Not to mentio  n, the treatment of American Indians. The reality is, in a majoritarian democracy, the issue of whether the majority is being ‚Äòtyrannical‚Äô is something that can only be decided, ultimately, by the majority!</p>

<p>Since we are on the topic, we already have a defense against the a tyrannical majority: the constitution.  Where is does not specifically defend against a case of majoritarian tyranny, we have a body of laws that serve as precedents that address at least some of those issues.  Where precedents fails, we can, at least in theory, amend the constitution to extend protections for some minority of the population‚Äìeven when that minority is not one of ethnicity or religion, but simply of ideological or political belief.  But the DSUp project, as we have often stated, is not for or against any specific changes to the law or the constitution. The task of averting the ‚Äòtyranny of the majority‚Äô falls squarely on the shoulders of the people‚Äìspecifically, on the shoulders of the majority at any given time on any given issue.</p>

<p>That said, a nation-wide system of DSUp direct legislatures does not aggravate, but actually ameliorates, the negative effects of majoritarianism‚Äìat least in general.  We do not claim that direct legislation will usher in an era of unprecedented domestic tranquility. We do hope to usher in an age of clear communication, good information, and genuine self-government so that even when we are at each others throats, we can argue more effectively and solve problems more quickly‚Äìand, also, solve problems to the greater satisfaction of a large proportion of the population than is currently possible.</p>

<p>Obviously it is possible to wish and hope for a union ‚Äòmore perfect‚Äô than this.  But let‚Äôs not allow, as is often said, the perfect to be the enemy of the good.</p>
