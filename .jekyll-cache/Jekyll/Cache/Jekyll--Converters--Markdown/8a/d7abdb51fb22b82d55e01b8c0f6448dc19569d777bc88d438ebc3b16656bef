I"=<p>This issue is somewhat fraught. Fraud at the polls is always a concern. There have been times in our nation’s history where politicians and political parties have ‘stuffed the ballot box’. And now that voting is increasingly done electronically, the task of rigging an election seems like it would be easier than ever. Each year, the House of Representatives votes on hundreds of bills. And now we are saying that hundreds of millions of people will be voting on each of those bills. How can we possibly be assured that all those votes are accurately totaled?</p>
