I"Š	<p>Itâ€™s all well and good to want to set up a direct legislature, but hereâ€™s the thing: what about the money?</p>

<p>Representatives get paidâ€“$174,000 per year, as of this writing.</p>

<p>The DSUp version of a direct legislature requires a tiered system of delegation. Some delegates will, in practice, be working full-time jobs.  Will they get paid for that?</p>

<p>The short answer is, thatâ€™s up to you. The site will give you the flexibility to do whatever you want on that score. But before we go too far down that road, lets establish some important facts.</p>

<p>Your direct legislature must be autonomous.  We describe the site and the DSUp Project as â€˜training wheels.â€™ We describe it as â€˜scaffoldingâ€™ that you can use to build your own â€˜building,â€™ i.e., the direct legislature in your district.  That first push, overcoming the forces of entropy or inertia or whatever you want to call it, that first push is the hardest and most critical.  Its vital to have as much help as possible during this stage. But once that stage is over, new forces come into play.  To the extent you participate actively in your direct legislature, youâ€™ll be engaged in the process of legislation.  No one is saying that it will be easy. Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>But your direct legislature will, then, be autonomous. And that is how it should be.  You would not want a third partyâ€“even the DSUp Project itself, which we think is awesomeâ€“controlling your districtâ€™s direct legislature.</p>

<p>That said, we lean heavily towards the idea of running your direct legislature without paying delegates until after your DSUp representative has taken a seat in congress.</p>

<p>Our thinking is, should you decide to pay delegatesâ€“at least, the ones who are obligated to enough work to warrant itâ€“you will no doubt be getting those funds from the voters participating in the direct legislature. Of course, it must never be the case that a voter <em>must pay</em> in order to participate in their districtâ€™s direct legislature and vote directly on legislation.  The only bar to entry must be getting signed up.  But, if your delegates are to be paid, the money canâ€™t come from any other source.  Imagine depending on a small number of large donations to run your DSUL.  That puts us right back in the same old position of certain interests having too much sway, of some Americans having more of a vote than others.</p>
