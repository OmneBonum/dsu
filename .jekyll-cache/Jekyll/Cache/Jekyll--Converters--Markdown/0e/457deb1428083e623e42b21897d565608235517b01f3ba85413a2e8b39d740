I"Ž<p>Before we start talking websites, let it be known: it will be possible to fully participate in your districtâ€™s Democracy Straight-Up Legislature without ever visiting a website, and without owning a smart phone, or a computer, or what have you. D-SUp should not be characterized as e-Democracy, although the two concepts necessarily have a great deal of overlap.</p>

<p>This is made possible because the fundamental unit of organization for a DSUL is a small group of people who elect from among their number a delegate to represent them.  This delegate has a relationship with each member of that small group that is dictated entirely by that member.  This is discussed in more detail here.</p>

<p>This means that communication can take place on the phone, by mail or fax, via singing telegram, using hand puppets or semifore.</p>

<p>But seeing as how it is the 2020, and not the year 1820 (link)</p>
