I"ø<p>The site strives to be politically neutral.  But we need to be careful: political neutrality may be used to sneakily support a biased agenda.</p>

<p>A good way to see this is to think of an earlier version of the Democracy Straight-Up Project.  It was called â€˜The Civil Democracy Project.â€™ At the time, it seemed like a good idea.  â€œCivilâ€ has the connotation of being for, by and about the people as opposed to the muck-a-mucks in charge.  So, that seemed nice.  But â€˜civilâ€™ also has the connotation of being polite and respectful and like that.  And thatâ€™s a good thing, too, right?</p>

<p>Actually, no, it isnâ€™t. Think about it.  Who are we to tell you how to be?  If you feel the need to be rude and disrespectful, who are we to police your behavior? Itâ€™s possible your opponent in a discussion holds an opinion that is so utterly repugnant, rudeness and disrespect are the only moral option in terms counter their argument.  This leads to the trouble with the term â€˜bi-partisan.â€™</p>
