Here, we are not talking about formatting and fonts.  We are talking about the authorial voice of the site.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-first-person-plural">Using the first person plural</h3>

<p>In this draft text, I vacillate between ‘I’ and ‘we.’ Eventually, we need to consistently use ‘we.’ I will use ‘I’ here because this is not text that will be part of the final site.</p>

<h3 id="limiting-allusions">Limiting allusions</h3>

<p>Don’t use, say, a literary reference where plain language will do the trick.  For instance, I want to write, “Depending on the influence they wield, some people’s vote is, in essence, larger than others.”  But this reminds me of <ins>Animal Farm</ins> by George Orwell.</p>
