<h3 id="using-the-first-person-plural">Using the first person plural</h3>

<p>In this draft text, I vacillate between ‘I’ and ‘we.’ Eventually, we need to consistently use ‘we.’ I will use ‘I’ here because this is not text that will be part of the final site.</p>

<h3 id="political-neutrality">Political neutrality</h3>

<p>This is a pretty obvious criterion, but devilishly difficult to avoid.  For instance, I just used the word ‘devilishly.’ Is that an allusion to Satan?  Does that mean I am siding for or against Christians?  Is one party more ‘Christian’ than another, so am I trying to send them a subtle message?  Looking back, I realize I capitalized the name ‘Satan.’ Does that imply that I think Satan is <em>worthy</em> of capitalization?</p>

<p>We should try to keep the site free from mentions of party affiliation, such as Democrat, Independent, Republican, etc.  We can just talk about, “One party or another” and that should do the trick. As for the future of political parties after ‘the singularity’–that day when all districts are direct legislatures–we should remember that we don’t really know what that future will look like. Should the project take a position that, in some way, looks dubiously upon the political parties in general and welcomes their weakening or dissolution?  I think that is going too far. We really can’t say that this will happen, or that it would be a good thing if it does.  We’ll just have to cross that bridge when we get to it.</p>

<p>Probably the best way to avoid political bias is to remember that we are not trying to change people from one type of person into another type of person.  Without question, a nation-wide system of direct legislatures <em>will</em> change people, but in ways that we can’t control and can’t predict.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples-are-to-be-avoided">Real-world examples are to be Avoided</h3>

<p>If, for instance, I wish to discuss what happens when something really divisive comes up for a vote.  So I attempt to explain by means of a real-world example, say, gun rights, or reproductive rights.  Or are the issues ‘gun control’ and ‘abortion?’ The reality is, it is impossible to use a real-world example without having to put it into concrete terms.  And putting something in concrete terms means putting it into language.  And language is always rife with bias.</p>

<p>The solution is to steer away from the concrete.  “What is a direct legislature is debating an issue that is divisive, with emotionally charged opinions on either side?” Let the reader call to mind whatever issue they think that describes.  It doesn’t matter which one it is, since we will never be taking sides, as an organization, on any issue. Which brings us to…</p>

<h3 id="displays-of-patriotism-unfortunately-are-biased">Displays of Patriotism, Unfortunately, are Biased</h3>

<p>The problem is, depending on the current political context, there may be one political party or group that many people think of as more patriotic than another.  Now, obviously the people who care about the project care about direct legislation, care about democracy, and care about the United States. But the moment you start to call yourself patriotic, or drape yourself in the flag, you are automatically singling out some group who might be being accused, rightly or wrongly, of being unpatriotic.  So we need to find the right tone, one that identifies the project as ‘patriotic’ without the flag-waving that characterizes ‘in-your-face’ patriotism, which can be used as a rhetorical weapon.</p>

<p>The site won’t have any pictures of the liberty bell or old glory. We won’t use old-timey fonts reminiscent of the Declaration of Independence and hope the perceived sophistication rubs off. What the site <em>should</em> look like, in the absence of that, is something we need to work out as we go.</p>

<p>At the same time, it needs to be clear that the site is for, by, and about Americans, and not the product of a Russian troll farm! We need to think about how to get that across from the outset.  In my experience, grammatically correct text and properly used idioms go a long way in that direction.</p>

<h2 id="make-text-clear-and-correct">Make text clear and correct</h2>

<p>My prose style is heavily influenced by <ins>The Elements of Style</ins> by Strunk and White. I am a stickler about setting off appositives with m-dashes (double hyphens,) rather than commas–at least where they add to the clarity and readability of a sentence (see what I did there?) A multi-word adjective should be hyphenated.  “Omit needless words” is a solid principle, but one we won’t always strictly adhere to for a few reasons. For instance, limitations on space for text are lessened in the digital age.  But also, more people are reading more text each day than ever before in human history, so demanding that the reader doggedly trace back every ‘this’ and ‘that’ to its source is becoming more and more unreasonable.</p>

<p>I feel the modern style should err, in this regard, on the side of being a bit more repetitive than the style that characterizes the print-only age, so that, no matter how technically correct the grammar of a sentence may be, if it isn’t very clear that a particular ‘this’ or ‘it’ refers to a particular concept, this principle should apply to it. Sorry, “the principle of erring on the side of reiterating the concept should apply to that instance of ‘this’ or ‘it’.”</p>

<h3 id="limiting-personality">Limiting personality</h3>

<p>I don’t like text that is completely dry, but we have to be careful about giving the authorial voice of the site too much personality. Since this has been a solo effort to date, the site is no doubt heavily laden with aspects of my personality. As a practical matter, these can never be entirely purged, but we can avoid the worst of it, such as trying to be cute, trying to impress, being too didactic, talking down to people, talking over their heads, etc.</p>

<h3 id="limiting-allusions">Limiting allusions</h3>

<p>Don’t use, say, a literary reference where plain language will do the trick.  For instance, I want to write, “Depending on the influence they wield, some people’s vote is, in essence, larger than others.”  But this reminds me of <ins>Animal Farm</ins> by George Orwell, namely the quote, “All animals are equal…but some animals are more equal than others.” Should I insert this in order to enrich my prose?  No, I should not.</p>
