I"t<p>Before we start talking websites, let it be known: it will be possible to fully participate in your districtâ€™s Democracy Straight-Up Legislature without ever visiting a website, and without owning a smart phone, or a computer, or what have you. D-SUp should not be characterized as e-Democracy, although the two concepts necessarily have a great deal of overlap.</p>
