The United States is divided into 435 congressional districts, each of which contained, as of the 2010 census, about 710,000 constituent.

A constituent is any person living in a district--whether or not they have the right to vote.  The largest block of non-voting constituents is that jobless, money-sucking population of trouble-makers we call children.  Well, legally speaking, we call them minors.  Reliably, the proportion of children in any given area hovers around one third.  So, a rough estimate of the number of adults in your district, using a nice round number that will make the math easier later on, is 450,000.  

This constitutes a maximum for the number of people that could possibly join your DSUL. Actual participation is certain to be lower. But we will use this number to strengthen our argument that the numbers involved are perfectly manageable, even at the extreme.

There are other considerations.  In some states, convicted felons cannot vote. Not all adults are citizens--and, yes, one must be a citizen to vote in an election.  

So, are you worried that people who are not citizens will join your DSUL?  What about people who are citizens, but don't really live in your district?  What about people who try to be sneaky and participate in more than one DSUL!  Yikes!

As far as we at the DSUp Project are concerned, we already have a means to determine who is eligible to vote.  We are happy to say that you can't join the DSUL unless you have a voter registration card.  This card will specify that you are registered to vote in the given congressional district where your DSUL abides.  

As it stands, only about two-thirds of legal citizens who are eligible to vote are registered to vote.  Getting registered needn't be a huge hurdle, but it is trickier for some people than it is for others.  So, when someone wants to join the DSUL, but is not yet registered, we're confident their fellow members will help them out if need be.  

We like to be careful when it comes to predictions about the future, but we do hope that this direct legislation project will have the effect of getting more people registered and getting more people to the polls for regular elections.  As we said, two-thirds of eligible voters aren't registered to vote.  But also, two-thirds of registered voters don't vote.  Fun with fractions, two-thirds of two-thirds is a bit less than 50%.  This number is low compared to most other developed, democratic countries.  

But let us remember what a DSUL really is: it is just method for a legally elected congressional representative to determine how they are going to vote on a bill being considered by the House of Representatives.  Because your rep can cast their vote based on any considerations they please, it is perfectly fitting and legal if they base their vote on the majority sentiment of their constituents as expressed through the DSUL in that district.  

But the DSUL itself is not a legally constrained entity.  We recommend that each DSUL start off by adopting the rule that every member must be registered to vote before they join.  But we are not in charge of enforcing that rule.

That's a good thing.  It would be an administrative nightmare.  Furthermore, its not our place to decide who is and isn't in your DSUL.  Finally, there's a much better way to do it.

We keep on touting the virtues of using the small group as the fundamental unit of Democracy Straight-Up. Here is where it really earns its place.  Ensuring that anyone who joins the DSUL has the right to do so under the rules laid down by the DSUL itself falls first and foremost to the other members of the small group of six to twelve.

But what if they try to break the rules?  What if they try to sneak in one or more people who aren't qualified to join?  What if all twelve of them are trying to pull a fast one?  

This is where the tiered system of delegation comes in very handy.  This group has to elect a delegate to represent them.  That delegate has to join a group of other delegates in tier one.  These groups are voluntary.  So, if a delegate that wants to join a tier one group will run into trouble if some or all of their base members aren't really qualified to be in the DSUL.  

One can imagine, however, ten or twenty such delegates getting together at the tier one level, forming a group, and electing a delegate to tier two!  We are talking possibly a hundred people or more, all of whom are not qualified to join the DSUL, and all of whom are, for some reason, trying to sneak in.  

Luckily, the groups forming tier two have the same right to accept or reject members as they please. That means, if they are doing due diligence, they can weed out any attempts at outright fraud.
