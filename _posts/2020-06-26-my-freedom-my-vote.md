The DSUp Project extolls an immutable principle: that every citizen has the right to vote directly on legislation. It is not simply that direct legislation is so much better than the current system of legislation by representation.  It is, but that is that is not the only underlying rationale.  It is certainly not true that direct legislation will be easier. It will be harder. Doable, worth it, but harder, especially at first. Direct legislation is not the path to a more certain future, to social tranquility, to an enlightened society, or what have. We hope all these things come to pass, we do in fact think that DSUp Project will help get us there, but again, this is not the reason we must all embrace direct legislation.

Say it with us, once more with feeling: Direct Legislation is not a priviledge, it is a right.

So, if that is our rationale, how do we defend it?  

We start with a series of simple observation--first, human beings can move of their own volition. Of course, all living things can move.  Even plants move.  The head of a sunflower follows the path of the sun as it arcs across the sky.  Animals, certainly, can move--that is what the word 'animal' means.  The question of volition, though, is a tricky one, though.  Does an animal want or choose to move?  Is it impelled to move by sheer instinct?  

Before we get lost in the weeds of philosophy, let's just keep things clean: human beings can move around in ways that are independent and unique to them, whether it is strictly voluntary is some sense of that word or not.  

The second observation is that human beings live in groups. There is really no way around it.  We can counterpose to this the example of a hermit living in the woods cut off from all other human beings.  But, on the face of it, this is irrelevant--precious few human beings really live that way all their adult lives. In any case, they have to have been born into a group, namely a family, even if that family was only a single mother.  And finally, they are not really free from the 'group system' that characterizes all human organization.

This is due to another observation: human beings live on land. Things being what they are, some group of human beings or other has lain claim to every inhabitable piece of land there is on the planet. So, to the extent it is sometimes true, in rare case, that someone lives completely alone, they do so because the group laying claim to the land allows them to.  

So, we are human beings.  We move around. We live in groups. We live on pieces of land. It is inevitable that as we move around we will, as it were, bump into each other. Because we live in groups there will be disputes as to who gets to move where and when. It is inevitable, also, that we will make use of the land that belongs to our group. And so, we are bound to disagree about how to use the land and its resources, who gets to do the using, and who reaps the benefits. This leads, by necessity to the creation of a set of rules.

Before we go any further down this train of thought, lets stop and remember: our ability to move, to interact with our environment, including the other human being around us, and the natural resources of the land upon which we find ourselves--those abilities are inherent.  They exist. And as such, we have a right to them. One can argue, at length, about the process by which such inherent abilities translate into inherent rights.  But, by the end of it, we will have found a certain argument that they do.  Insert that argument here.  

Since this inherent right is governed by the necessity of rules, we can think of those rules always, in some way, limiting what we call 'freedom.' The term freedom can mean slightly different things to different people, so it is convenient to sometimes use the word 'agency'. Here, agency refers to the ability to act--think of how we might call someone a 'free agent,' even when we are not talking about sports. So, since rules limit agency we can say something very certain about the nature of those rules--every agent must have an equal say in determining those rules.

By the way, we are supposing, here, that our 'group' is a democracy, with universal suffrage, that protects freedom of speech, and a range of essential human and civil rights. There is no other form of government worth even considering.

Our final observation is that, unlike all other animals, we engage in a very complex form of communication called language.  Where language fails, war begins.  This is not a problem if you are a bear.  A bear may maul another bear that wanders into its territory, and no one makes any moral judgements about it.  It doesn't have the option of engaging in reasoned discourse. Since the very definition of a civil society is one that is not openly at war with itself, in the literal sense, we should look at how disputes can be settled in the absence of violent conflict. We don't just have the option of reasoned discourse.  It is our only choice under the aforementioned conditions.

It is easy see that, if we all 'own our agency,' and must, of necessity submit to rules governing the scope and extent of that agency, and if we live in a peaceful, democratic society where those rules must be determined by reasoned discourse, then we must all, by right, have equal access to determining what those rules are, and an equal vote when it comes to enacting those rules into law.  

And that's all we have to say about that.
