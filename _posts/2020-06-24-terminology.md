Terminology

Unavoidably, we have had to coin some terminology of our own in order to make the underlying ideas for a project on direct legislation more comprehensible.  

We have tried to avoid too many unique coinages, but certain acronyms have, inevitably, risen up base on the names we have had to give things.  For instance, a Democracy Straight-Up Legislature has become a DSUL which we pronounce dee-sul, like the fuel.  

Also, we have settled on some recommended terms that simply make it easier to talk about the subject of direct legislation by shortening some of the multi-syllabic verbiage that clutters up even the most basic discussion of democracy--for instance, the term House Rep.

DSUL--Democracy Straight-Up Legislature

We pronounce this term 'dee-sul', like the fuel. A DSUL is a type of direct legislature.  We want to acknowledge that some other project might propose some other form for a direct legislature, and that our form isn't the only possibility (although, we do think it is the best!). Unless otherwise specified, when we use the term D-Leg (which means district legislature) it will be synonymous with  DSUL.  

D-Leg--District Legislature or Direct Legislature

District Legislature--D-Leg

The DSUp proposes the creation of 435 direct legislatures, one for each congressional district in the United States. This means that a district legislature is type of direct legislature.  

Direct Legislature--D-Leg

A direct legislature is any body in a democracy through which all enfranchised voters may vote directly on legislation.

Franchise (Voting Franchise)

This is the tradition term for designating what group within a society is allowed to vote.  If, for instance, women are not allowed to vote, then the franchise extends to men, and women are referred to as disenfranchised.  The term 'universal franchise' applies to the current US system, in that all adult citizens have the right to vote, although citizens under the age of 18 are still, technically, disenfranchised.

Voter

A 'voter,' for our purposes, is usually someone who has 'taken their seat' in their district DSUL.  But, when we are talking about general elections, or Americans in general, voter might mean anyone who votes in any election.  To be clear, 'voter' is one of the 'official' terms we use for 'a member of a DSUL.'

Top Group

This is our half-serious, half-cheeky way of referring to a small group of base voters who get together as a unit and put forward a delegate to represent them in the Upper Tier of their DSUL. The term is part of our effort to 'flip the paradigm' and actually put the voters on the top of the hierarchy of power in our democracy. This leads to all sorts of awkwardness and confusion, but we are hoping the chaos created will be creative and not destructive.

Bottom Tier

The Bottom Tier of your DSUL will eventually be a group of about 10 people who represent every voter in your district who is a member of your D-Leg. Your elected House Rep will essentially just be a member of this group, albeit, shehe will have the legal right to enter the floor of the House and actually cast your votes. See House Rep for more.

House Rep

We feel the need to purge our discussions of democracy of at least some of the polysyllabic terms foisted on us by the colorful origins of the English language.  'Rep' in place of 'representative' is highly encouraged.  As a corollary to this, some related terms are deprecated: congressional representative, congressperson, congressman, congresswoman, and the like. See Congress for more.

Congress

To the extent possible, we try to avoid the word 'congress' in our discussion of direct legislation.  The chief reason is that it is confusing and always has been.  Congress, strictly speaking, is both the House of Representatives and the Senate taken together.  A 'congressperson-man-woman-etc' can therefore be either.  But in the public mind, this distinction is not clear, and congressperson can mean someone in the House of Representatives as distinct from a Senator.  No one is to blame for this. Also, we are not trying to change usage outside the confines our discussions of the DSUp and direct legislation.  More importantly, the DSUp does not really address issues pertaining to congress because it does not address any issues pertaining to the Senate.  The changes we advocate apply only to the House of Representatives, not congress as a whole.  

House (The)

We encourage the use of the term 'The House' rather than 'The House of Representatives' whenever possible.  Also, 'US House' rather than 'The United States House of Representatives.'  Shorter terminology is not just about efficiency--studies have shown that the human brain performs better when the basic units being manipulated for a complex task are simpler in design.  This is why human beings instinctively shorten terms that are both very important and often repeated.

Flip the paradigm

This is a term that still haunts those of us who lived through the 1980's, and, unfortunately, it is completely apropos to what we are up to with the DSUp.  The paradigm in the past has been that 'the people' or 'the voters' are 'the base.'  That means that they are at the bottom of some sort of structure, which could be envisioned as a pyramid.  They are even referred to as the 'grass roots,' to reinforce their importance--a plant will die without its roots--but also to reinforce that idea that the average voter is stuck in the mud and hidden from sight.  

Base, The

In our conception of democracy, a 'representative' no longer represents a 'base.'  We still struggle with the perfect terminology, but we feel happiest when we think of the people as an all-powerful Board of Directors.  Sure, in this case, it is a very large Board of Directors, which has organized itself into a tiered system of delegation in order to function, but at the bottom of that system (not the top) is the 'delegate' that expresses the will of the The Board on the floor of the House.   

Upper, Middle and Lower Tiers

These are the three tiers of delegation between a voter and their House Rep.  They are part of a system for the flow of information in two directions: from Voter to Rep, and from Rep to Voter.  In the Voter to Rep direction, they serve to articulate the will of the voters as efficiently and effectively as is possible.  In the Rep to Voter direction, the tiered system serves to make sure the Voters have the information they need to make well-informed decisions.

Claim Your Seat

This really just means 'sign up.'  But what we are getting at here is that your district legislature already exists, you just have to decide whether or not you are going to sit in the seat that awaits you. Or, you know, you could leave it empty. Just sitting there. Empty. Draped in a shroud of neglect and lost opportunities...

Enter the Floor

In the US House, a rep has to enter the floor in order to vote.  When the roll call is taken, the rep has to be on the floor to be counted in the roll.  Each rep has a card they insert into into one of the electronic voting machines located on the floor which enables them to cast their vote, yea, nay, or present. There is, currently, no way for a rep to cast a vote if they are not physically present on the floor of the House.

In our case, Entering the Floor means signing in to our account, which does allow us to cast votes using our own 'electronic voting devices,' namely, laptop, desktop, smartphone, etc. In our case, though, there is a way to vote without ever entering the floor. Any Top Group voter can, if they choose, cede their proxy to their Top Group Delegate on any and all votes. This proxy is, of course, revokable at any point in time before the vote closes on the floor of the House.

Revokable Proxy

The revokable proxy allows voters to hand some or all of their votes over to the delegate they have put forward. This frees voters from having to be an expert on every single issue, and enables them to hand over the decision-making responsibility to someone who they (presumably) trust. It also allows delegates lower down in the tiered system of delegation to amass proxies which can be used as bargaining chips in negotiating the scope and content of legislation. Another benefit is that we all have lives.  There will always be times when personal circumstances will make it impossible to be fully informed even on those issues we care most passionately about. A Top Group Delegate is someone who can be trusted to take up the slack, and vote, to the best of their ability, as you would vote, based on their knowledge of your beliefs and attitudes. By the way, if you do not trust your Top Group Delegate to vote as you would vote, you have options: you can either put forward a different Top Group Delegate, or find a new Top Group with a delegate you do trust.  And, once again, you can always check what your Top Group Delegate is doing with your vote, and if you don't like what you see, take back (revoke) your proxy, and vote as you please.  

Proxy

Whenever you empower someone to do something on your behalf, they are behaving as your 'proxy'.  The term is used more specifically in the sense of 'proxy voting.'  This means you can send someone to a meeting, say, that you cannot attend but at which some important decision is being decided.  You can entrust them with your vote on the issue.  Not knowing what may happen at the meeting, and what issues might suddenly arise, you don't tell that person, "Vote yes" or "Vote no." Instead, you discuss the various eventualities and come to an agreement as to how you would vote under different circumstances.  Of course, your 'proxy voter' must exercise a great deal of judgement--that is why you need to choose someone you trust.  And of course, you could give your proxy instructions like, "Vote with the majority, I don't care," or, "Whatever you decide, cast my vote the same," or "Anything that son-of-a-bitch Brian does, do the opposite!" or any other set of instructions you can imagine.  

Top Group delegate

This is the the lynch pin for the entire tiered system of delegation.  The Top Group Delegate is the difference between living in a Mosh Pit Democracy, where the Will of the People flops around like a fish on dry land, and Democracy Straight-Up, where the Will of the People flows gently down stream to the representative into congress and becomes the law of the land. The relationship between a voter and their TGD has two essential features: one, each delegate has a manageable number of voters they serve--thats why we set the group size at no more than 12--and, two, each voter sets the terms of the relationship, from a blanket proxy, to some combination so proxies and direct votes, to complete control of every vote in all circumstances. There are only three links in the chain between you, the voter, and your representative in congress, and in many ways, your TGD is the most important.  At the same time, it is a tough job--that's why the responsibility can be split or shared in many different ways, to accommodate the realities of daily life.

Upper Tier Group

Top Group Delegates form into Upper Groups.  Now, we can't tell you what exactly your Upper Group will decide to do with the time they spend together in meetings.  How often they meet is ultimately up to you.  We'll provide a framework--the scaffolding--to serve as training wheels to get you started, but ultimately there is nothing in the scaffolding that you in your DSUL can't change (by democratic vote, of course!) That said, at the moment, we imagine that the essential functions of any given upper group will be three-fold: one, each TGD will advocate for the concerns that are most important to the Top Group Members they represent and use this to come up with a set of instructions for the Middle Tier Group, two, the Upper Tier Group will receive replies from the Middle Tier Group, on the basis of which they will, a) send back further instructions, or, b) pass the information on to any members of herhis Top Group (voters) who have designated that they require such information. And, before we forget, three, the Upper Tier Group will put forward one of their number to represent their interests in a Middle Tier Group.

It is important to emphasize that an Upper Tier Group serves at the behest of the 50 to 150 or so voters they represent.  How exactly they function is up to those voters. For instance, if an Upper Tier Group can do their business to the satisfaction of their voters in less than an hour a week, and convey 'the will of the people' to the Middle Tier with a minimum of fuss and muss, then more power to them.  If it turns out they must do a lot more than that to satisfy their voters, then so be it.  The only important thing is that the flow of power goes from the Top to the Upper.  That is, the voters place demands on their Top Group delegate, and, therefor, the Upper Tier in general, and never, never, never, never, never, never, the other way around.  The Upper Group may ask, politely (we assume) for some sort of information from the voters.  Top Group Delegates are of course free to ask their members to do anything they can imagine (we live in a free country, don't we?)  But this is true only with the clear understanding that the voters they represent have the absolute and sacrosanct right to say, "No!" (They also live in a free country, now don't they?)  

There is much to unpack here in terms of the TGD/voter relationship.  For instance, what if an Upper Tier Group gets instructions from their voters, relays those instructions to the Middle Tier Group of which they are a member, and after being handed down to the Lower and Bottom Tiers, comes back with a request for more information or feedback from the voters.  Top Group Delegates can ask for this information, but the voters they rep are free to say, "Figure it out for yourself!  I'm going fishing!"  

This is where TGDs need to do the best they can to rep the interests of the voters in their Top Group, or, if they are frustrated with the reaction they get from their voters, they are always free to a) resign as a delegate or b) find a Top Group that is more to their liking.
