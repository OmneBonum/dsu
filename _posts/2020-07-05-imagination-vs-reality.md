Imagine the following:

You sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a piece of legislation.  You watch a lot of television, and you've seen
countless ads urging people like you to vote agains this particular piece of
legislation.  You go on line and vote, "No!" finish your coffee, and pat yourself on the back for a job well-done.

It is now time to say, in screaming all-caps, THIS IS NOT THE PROCESS OF DIRECT
LEGISLATION!!!

You sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a piece of legislation. You commence your research.  You read through
the legislation word by word.  You go to a dizzying array of websites, researching,
fact-checking, weighing the issues involved from various different perspectives.
You come across the names of people who might be able to answer the many questions
that have been gathering in your mind, so you shoot them some e-mails and messages,
hoping that will take you seriously enough to respond.  Eventually, the deadline for the vote comes along, so you go to an on-line voting site and cast your vote.

THIS IS NOT THE PROCESS OF DIRECT LEGISLATION!!!

You sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a several new pieces of legislation.  You go to a website that lists
the bills coming to the floor.  You read the name of each piece of legislation, and
click 'yes' or 'no' based how you like the sound of the title.
