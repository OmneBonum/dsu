Imagine the following:

You sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a piece of legislation.  Since you already watch a lot of television, you've seen
countless ads urging people like you to vote against this particular piece of
legislation.  So, you automatically go on line and vote, "No!" finish your coffee, and pat yourself on the back for a job well-done.

It is now time to say, in screaming all-caps, THIS IS NOT THE PROCESS OF DIRECT
LEGISLATION!!!

Again, imagine, if you will:

You sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a piece of legislation. Time to go into research mode!  You read through
the legislation word by word.  You go to a dizzying array of websites, researching,
fact-checking, weighing the issues involved from various different perspectives.
You come across the names of people who might be able to answer the many questions
that have been gathering in your mind, so you shoot them some e-mails and messages,
hoping that will take you seriously enough to respond.  Eventually, the deadline for the vote comes along, so you go to an on-line voting site and cast your vote.

Again, for the vast majority of people,

THIS IS NOT THE PROCESS OF DIRECT LEGISLATION!!!

How about this one:

Imagine, you sit down at your computer and receive a notification that congress is about
to vote on a several new pieces of legislation.  You go to a website that lists
the bills coming to the floor.  You read the name of each piece of legislation, and
click 'yes' or 'no' based how you like the sound of the title.

Yes, you guessed it, once more with feeling....

The point here is that there are thousand ways to imagine the process of direct legislation, and many of them are crap-tastic. This means it is very easy for anyone not inclined towards the idea of direct legislation to conjure up a grotesque image of what it could look like. It also means that, while we don't want you to take this too personally, there may be many such grotesques haunting your own imagination. Part of the goal of this site is to take you through the process, however long it takes, of exorcising those ghosts.
