If you've read the post "Why Go Big?" it may seem ironic that I now have to address the question "Why So Small?"

But the world is filled with different types of people.  And just as some might naturally think that acting at the Federal level, all at once, would be overly ambitious, others might go the other way.

The DSUp project targets only Federal Congressional districts.  That is, the 435 seats that make up the United States House of Representatives.  So, naturally, for come, the question arises, "Why stop there?  What about lawmaking at all the other levels of government?  What about the Senate?"

I've touched on the issue of starting out with lower levels of government (municipal, county, state and what not) and why that is unwise.  But what about the Senate? How can we revolutionize the way the House operates, and leave the Senate untouched?

This is, in one sense, a legacy problem. If we had a unicameral legislature, this wouldn't be an issue.

There are some who say that the Senate should represent the people proportionally, or that it shouldn't exist at all. The DSUp Project takes no official position on such questions. What the US Senate looks like in the future is up to the American people.  It will be enough to revamp the House in terms of direct participation in lawmaking. For all we know, it may never be necessary to make any changes whatsoever to how the Senate operates.

For the mean time, we embrace the existence of the Senate for the same reasons given for its creation in the first place. It can function as a 'cooling saucer' when the people pass legislation that is ill-advised, or too 'hot-headed.'    

The DSUp project limits itself to only the 435 districts that currently exist in the 50 states.  Also, what about Washington D.C.?  What about Puerto Rico?  What about other U.S. territories and possessions?  Is it unfair to exclude their voices?

For better or worse, that is a political question which falls outside the scope of this project. It is a question to be pondered--and perhaps voted on--after the system of direct legislation is in place.  The DSUp Project does not propose any changes to existing law or the constitution. As such, it builds on the legacy handed down to us.  That legacy is strong enough to support what we need to do to make direct legislation a reality.
