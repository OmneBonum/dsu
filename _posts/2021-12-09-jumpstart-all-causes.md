One of the great things about The DSUp Project, which I would like to impress on
those giving it its day in court, is that it is The Cause to Jumpstart All Causes.

Think about it this way.  Imagine a major change to the law, at the federal level,
that is associated with a majority sentiment of voters, right now, in America. There
are more than a few of those, haunting the zeitgeist.  

Really, you'll have to imagine one.  I'm not going to give an example.  Any example
I offer will make it seem like the Project is partisan, in some way, on that issue.
For some issues, even bringing them up is partisan.  So you'll really need to settle on
something in your own head to proceed. Focus--there is an issue. It has a legislative aspect.
A majority of Americans approve of the legislation.  It's still not getting done.

Can you see it?

So, here's the thing: after the Direct Revolution, that cause will no longer be
stalled.  That legislation, which the majority of voters actually wants, will be passed
and will become law. And don't forget, also, that legislation, which your cause wants to
<em>remove</em> and which a majority of voters would also like to see go bye-bye--well,
if you had DDL's all across America right now, it wouldn't even be an issue.  The law
would be repealed, rescinded, revoked, gone!  

Now, that seems like a beautiful thing, and it is...but it does come at a price. If you get
to have your way on something that you believe in along with the majority, it also means
that an idea you vehemently abhor has its chance to be codified into law if a majority
of American voters endorse it.

Yikes!

Can you see it?  Are you imagining it?  Is it scary?

What can I say, that's they way it's gotta be.  If you really think the majority is
going to do something stupid, stop relying on some sneaky tactic to trick them out of it.
Get your arguments ready and do battle--rhetorically speaking.

"Direct Legislation is a rising tide that lifts all boats."  Who said that?  It must have been
someone very wise. 

So, people, join the cause that is your cause no matter what your cause! Email me
