Just spent the whole day trying fix problems with the website...and failing to do so.  

So, some of these blog posts will really just be progress reports, but the upshot of
this one is that I will need assistance on the website just to get it working well-enough.  

Right now, well enough means that it no longer looks like a throwback to website design
circa Y2K.  

I registered my Project with a site called DonateCode.com, which is supposed to hook up coders
with worthy projects that need volunteers.  The site is not based in the US, though,
so there was only one coder located in the US.  That's the funny thing about this project.
Let's say I find an awesome web developer and I hire them to build the site.  Like this
one guy, in Ukraine who got his experience working for the military.  Eventually someone
is going to pen a headline like, "Democracy Project Created by Ukrainian Ex-Military
Contractor."  You know they will do that, you just know they will.

I spent the day trying to change something called a favicon.  You don't need to know what
that is.  I now wish I did not know what that is.  Anyway, nothing I did worked.  (Okay
  it's that little icon you see on the browser tab, like that world icon for Wikipedia.)

At this rate the robot army will have taken over the world and enslaved us all before I
get this site working the way it should.

So, people, talk code to me! Email me at OmneBonumEst+bl@gmail.com.
