Here, we are not talking about formatting and fonts.  We are talking about the authorial voice of the site.

### Using the first person plural

In this draft text, I vacillate between 'I' and 'we.' Eventually, we need to consistently use 'we.' I will use 'I' here because this is not text that will be part of the final site.

### Limiting allusions

Don't use, say, a literary reference where plain language will do the trick.  For instance, I want to write, "Depending on the influence they wield, some people's vote is, in essence, larger than others."  But this reminds me of <ins>Animal Farm</ins> by George Orwell.
