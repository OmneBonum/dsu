One of the practical considerations we have employed in designing the Democracy
Straight-Up Project is the need to entirely eliminate campaigning from politics.

I know, right?  It's one of the fundamentals of our democracy, ain't it?  Campaigning
is at the very heart of the American experiment.  It is emblematic of some of our
most-cherished freedoms---Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Assembly, to be specific.  

Okay, I hear your cries of distress at the thought of <em>eliminating all political
campaigns</em> but bear with me.  Doesn't campaigning have a dark side?
A really, really dark side?  I mean, is it something we all universally love?  Or
is it more like a necessary evil that we have learned to thinly tolerate?

Let's jot down a quick list. What are the dynamics that go into campaigning?

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Item 1</span>: Back in the day, the founders might have imagined a gentleman farmer 'tossing
his hat in the ring' and having just as much of a chance as anyone else of representing the other
citizens of his district (or, at least, the other gentleman farmers of his district...).
But we all know that ship has sailed.  In fact, no one's really sure that ship ever
even existed.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Item 2</span>: It costs a lot of money to run for congress---you need to bank at least a million dollars.
And while that's not a lot of money in the scheme of things, it's still a lot of money for
a homemaker from Poughkeepsie (or some other regular person). It's a very expensive hat to be tossing around. Especially
when the odds, on average, are greater than fifty-percent that you'll lose.

So, there is the need to raise funds to run, which has lead to endless headaches. There's
a gnawing contradiction that undergirds the whole enterprise.  The candidate must pledge to
objectively serve the needs of the constituents.  And yet, they may be entirely funded
by a small subset of those constituents who have special needs and a glaringly obvious
pathway to getting those needs met, whether they are good or bad for the rest of the
constituency.  

Let's face it, when it comes to the question, "Is my candidate basically a puppet?" we
mostly cross our fingers and hope it is not true, or, if it is, not completely true
all the time, and maybe sometimes the needs of the not-so-well-monied constituents are being
served, well enough? Pretty please?

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Item 3</span>: Campaigns are also tied up with political party politics.  If you choose to run for office,
and your politics don't fit neatly into one camp or the other (which is true for most
Americans) then you either need to conform your views to the party (which may be controlled
by money) in order to tap into the powerful campaign machinery at their disposal, or
run as an independent, and take your chances. Which can be done, but wouldn't it be
better if every candidate ran as an independent?  Isn't that more, I don't know, American?

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Item 4</span>: Then there are the dynamics inherent
in getting all those ill-informed, distracted, apathetic voters to rally around you. Now, it would be great if a candidate, expressing themselves frankly and making reasoned arguments, attracted the sober consideration of all the
denizens of a district, who then formulated an assessment as to whether or not to embrace
said candidate.  

But here on planet earth, we are stuck with homo sapiens, and despite how we named ourselves,
we are not particularly 'wise' in that particular way.

It's no one's fault. The dynamics at play during a campaign make honesty, from the candidate,
and sober assessment, from the base, physically and psychologically impossible.  To be clear,
human beings are definitely capable of using their faculties to make rational decisions. But with
a candidate constantly shaping and adjusting their message to anticipate what a certain
group of voters may or may not think, and with voters treating the whole spectacle of politics as
a kind of real-life version of World of Warcraft, at no moment in time does anyone have
the luxury of being perfectly reasonable.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">What to do, what to do?</span>

If it were possible to get rid of campaigning altogether, that would be highly
desirable.  Not so much for the people who have the power to control who does and doesn't
run for office. Such people might be unenthusiastic about the Death of Campaigning.
But for the rest of us, it would be pretty ideal.  Of course, we are not talking about <em>banning</em>
 campaigns. We still have our freedoms which must be preserved.  It would have to be like this:
you <em>could</em> campaign if you wanted to, but it wouldn't do you any good,
 and might even hurt your chances of getting elected, if you engaged in that sort of unseemly behavior.

Ah, me.  If only there were some way to do that, to really put an end to this very
unsavory, morally compromising way of selecting candidates for office. Sigh.

But there is no hope.  Nope.  No hope whatsoever.  There has never been a solution to the dark
necessity of political campaigning, and there never will be.

(Note to Self: Should I put a winky-face after that? Nah, they'll get it.)
