The site strives to be politically neutral.  But we need to be careful: political neutrality may be used to sneakily support a biased agenda.

A good way to see this is to think of an earlier version of the Democracy Straight-Up Project.  It was called 'The Civil Democracy Project.' At the time, it seemed like a good idea.  "Civil" has the connotation of being for, by and about the people as opposed to the muck-a-mucks in charge.  So, that seemed nice.  But 'civil' also has the connotation of being polite and respectful.  And that's a good thing, too, right?

Actually, no, it isn't. Think about it.  Who are we to tell you how to be?  If you feel the need to be rude and disrespectful, who are we to police your behavior? It's possible your opponent in a discussion holds an opinion that is so utterly repugnant, rudeness and disrespect are the only moral option in terms of countering their argument.  

This leads to the trouble with the term 'bi-partisan.' Bi-partisanship clearly has its place.  But it can also be used as a way to bully the other side into concessions they aren't comfortable with. It can be a way of closing down an argument before the most contentious issues are addressed.  

This may be the flaw in many a project falling under the general rubric of 'direct democracy.' They always seem to think, implicitly or explicitly, that shoving citizens who bitterly disagree with each other into the same room and encouraging them to duke it out will somehow result in love, peace and understanding--or something like that. But you really have to ask yourself, how much of your day do you want to devote to being locked in battle with people who you despise? Do you really want us to lecture you about 'active listening' or give you self-help advice about 'getting to yes?'

How about this philosophy: "The other side is wrong, they will never be convinced that they are wrong, so the only option is to outvote them, pass the legislation, and prove them wrong!" The project itself, clearly, can't take that position.  But you can.  And we can at least refrain from trying to psych you out of that position, perhaps on the basis that you aren't behaving in a 'civil' manner towards your fellow citizens.

### Does the DSUp Project Encourage Partisanship?

Once you get to know the project better, you will notice an interesting feature that we think, over time, will cause controversy.  

We welcome the controversy.  Although, to be fair, we have little choice but to do so.

If you read about the [fundamental unit of democracy]({% post_url 2020-07-08-the-fundamental-unit %}) (at least as we see it) you may notice that the small group you will be encouraged to form (or join) will be entirely voluntary.  In fact, we encourage you to group together with people you like, or at least respect. People who you agree with on most things--or, at a minimum, you are comfortable disagreeing with. Such organizing principles will tend to support the creation of groups that are like-minded and speak with the same voice.  We do think this will be a good thing, but we also see it as unavoidable.  Exactly because people, as a general rule, do not want to spend a great deal of time interacting with people they don't like!  Pretty simple. And if we were to demand, as many other democracy-friendly projects do, explicitly or implicitly, that you just 'suck it up' and *become* the kind of person who is comfortable engaging in ideological combat all day long, then we would be trying to change who you are now into some presumably new-and-improved version of you.  But this we will not attempt, and we don't think it would be right if we did.

So, grouping with like-minded people makes the process not just more enjoyable--it really is the essential nugget that makes the whole thing possible at all.  Notice also, if you think about these groups electing a delegate, they are selecting one person to speak for many, so to the extent your group agrees, that makes your delegates job alot easier, and increases the efficiency of the system.

That is the fundamental unit, which elects a delegate, who goes on to the first tier and *joins another voluntary group!* This means you may see, in your district legislature, groups of 150 or so people who all agree on the same issue--some might say, who 'all live in the same bubble,'--being represented by one, second tier  delegate!  It gets 'worse' (or 'better,' depending on your perspective.) That second tier delegate is part of *another* group that is constituted voluntarily, and which could be (but doesn't *have* to be) strongly partisan on one or more issues.  That group elects a delegate to the next tier, which we sometimes call the District Assembly, each member of which could potentially represent about 3,000 people!  All of whom, again, could potentially be partisan in the same way on the same issues.  But consider this: another word for 'bubble' is 'happy place.'

A system of direct democracy designed to dilute partisanship is foisting an agenda on the public and trying to enforce a singular view of human nature.

Now, at some point, and we think it is probably at this tier, that of the District Assembly, that voluntary groupings may not suffice.  This decision will ultimately be in the hands of the Delegation to the Representative--a group of about ten people who interact directly with the DSUL-elected representative in your district. Things get a little mathematical at this point, so bear with us. We reccommend 10 groups of 15 people at the third tier of representation (the District Assembly).
