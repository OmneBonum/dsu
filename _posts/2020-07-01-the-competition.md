There are all sorts of other projects out there centering on the issue of democratic participation, and we find all of them come up short.

This make sense.  We wouldn't want to waste time reduplicating what others have already done.  If there were some other organization out there doing that which, to our way of thinking, needs to be done, then we would join that organization and devote our efforts to making it work.  In fact, the creation of the Democracy Straight-Up! Project started with a long process of trying to find such an organization or movement.  But we just couldn't find anyone out there who got it right.  

The approach taken by this site is typical--and typically ineffective: [Link](http://forums.e-democracy.org/)

We use the logo from this site as tiling for the top of this page.  Here it is again:

![E-democracy Logo](/images/edemlogo.jpg){:class="footer-logo"}

Note what this symbol represents: a circle of people, as seen from above, holding hands.  Aw, that's so sweet!  Maybe they are children, from all around the world! Maybe they are lifting their voices in song!  

We kid, but this is the kind of thing that has characterized pro-democracy movements from the beginning. Whether it is subtle or overt, they dictate a notion of how humans should behave that will ultimately make many people uncomfortable. Who are those people you are making me hold hands with?  Do I find their beliefs utterly distasteful?  Why are you forcing me into your hippy love-circle?

The first page of the site, right up at the top, invites people to volunteer.  Small point, but volunteer for what?  Buy me dinner first... And there is another icon with people holding hands.  Hippies.

Then there are some top posts from their various forums.  These will differ depending on when you follow the link provided above. On our visit one headline screamed at us about millions of dollars being wasted on an ill-conceived plan to end homelessness, one exhorting people to stand up to 'false narratives' being pushed by newspaper editors (with poor spelling) and another...oh, good grief!  Providing people with yet another forum to shout their personal agenda at other people shouting their personal agenda is not increasing democracy. Unless that forum is empowered to actually vote through legislation, what is the point?  And why should I return to such a forum, day after day, so that I can be shouted at by other people who have concocted a reason to be outraged by some injustice or other?  The worst of it is, they may have a point, but how the hell am I supposed sift the wheat from the chaff?  

The point of the DSUp website is to provide a place where you can go about the business of self-government with a minimum of distractions and annoyances. Most importantly, you'll be able to control from the outset the process by which you filter the signal from the noise, so that with comparatively little effort, you can dig into the issues that are important to you, learn about issues you really might be interested in, and get the information you need to satisfy yourself that you are making the right decision when you vote on a bill before congress.  This is all made possible by the tiered system of delegation, where you *delegate* all the hard work to people you trust. What's more, using the same system of tiered delegation, you can even 'farm out' the entire process, if you wish, including the final decision as to how to vote.

A lot could be said about this site and others like it.  We would like to just point out that providing 'open forums' and encouraging 'civic participation' are not solutions, however doggedly their proponents may wish them to be. As evidence of this, we would like to point out that this E-democracy project has been in existence since 1994--that's more than 25 years as of this writing.  And, dollars to donuts, this is the first you've ever heard of it.  

There is one overarching criticism that seems to be true for every democracy-oriented project out there.

They urge voters to increase their involvement without offering any increase in power.

This is an extremely important point. It is worth stopping and really letting it sink in.

The DSUp Project starts with the promise that "You will have a direct, binding, effective, real-life vote on every bill that comes before congress."

Yes, it may only be one vote out of 500,000, if we are looking at your district alone. Or one vote out of 200 million, if we look at the entirety of the United States. So it could be argued that this one vote thing is rather paltry.

But consider this--right now, for the overwhelming majority of you reading this right now, you have *less than one vote.*  

It is the inevitable effect of the current system that people with the money and the means have greater influence on how a representative votes, and therefor have, in effect, a bigger vote.

### Inclusiveness. Giving voters a voice. Good grief...

Many projects talk about 'giving citizens a voice' and 'promoting inclusiveness.'

It may surprise you to learn that the DSUp Project does not aim to do either of these things.  

What? A democracy project that *doesn't* want to give people a voice?

You already have a voice. You can stand on the street corner and spout your opinions till the cows come home, if you like. You can start your own newsletter--Gutenburg would be green with envy at what your desktop printer can do.  You can start your own website (like we did!) or post on any number of on-line forums, including some that are completely (or mostly) uncensored. And, every once in a while at least, politicians hold events where you can show up in person and yell at them.  

You already have a voice.  What you do not have is a vote.

Of course, the vote we are talking about here is not the vote you have when it comes to political representation.  We are talking about the vote you should have directly effecting the outcome of proposed legislation.

Now, will having a vote change how you use your voice?  Probably.  Will membership in a DSUL give you a better forum in which to use your voice?  That's the plan!  

The point is, right now you have a voice, but for most people, using it is a frustrating and fruitless experience. It is yelling into the wind.  The fact is, you can speak all you like, but unless you have some sort of power over other people, no one has to listen to you!

Then it comes to the functions of democratic self-government, the only power you should have is that of persuasive argument, or the trust you've earned from a long history of acting in good faith, etc.  The kind of power we are railing against here is the power to force people to do things that are not in their own self-interest, without explanation. We are talking about various forms of persuasion, not by force of argument, but by force of force.  

This is the current system, where people with some kind of power get to have a bigger vote. It starts with the pool of candidates for office, which right from the get go is skewed towards representing the vested interests of those with more power and influence. And it continues throughout the term of any sitting representative, in the form of lobbying and influence and the like.

But let's be clear--we don't care who is to blame for this, it is just the way things work when you don't have a direct legislature. We just need to fix this one aspect of the system, and it won't be as much of a problem any more. To underscore the point here, this is not an 'us' vs. 'them' situation.  It is not 'the fault' of the people who have money, power, and influence that they use it.  The onus is not necessarily on any individual to stop acting in their own self-interest for the greater good.  Especially when they are obeying the law and working within the existing system.  

This is why campaigns for democracy that rely on 'raising awareness' and 'promoting consciousness,' etc., will not work in this case. Even if a large group of people with power exercise some sort of self-control and stop using the system to their own advantage, these people will always eventually be pushed out by people who *are* willing to use the system to their advantage. As far as we can tell, there is no way to get everyone to subscribe to the exact same set of principles. Society is complex.  Individuals are complex. Our lives are filled with intricate dynamics that are impossible to quantify of qualify in any objective way. There is really no reason to believe that a certain code of conduct could or should be adhered to by every individual regardless of circumstance.  That is, except in the case of conduct that must be governed by law.  

So, lets not point fingers at some group of people whose behavior is 'just ruining everything for the rest of us!'  Because their behavior really is a function of our behavior.  And while we behave the way people behave when they are living in democracy upside-down, a certain maldistribution of democratic power is going to arise. The solution is not to yell at a certain group of people and try to make them feel bad. The solution is to turn democracy upside-up. [link to post?]

Neither do we aim to "promote inclusiveness".

Sounds crazy for a project like this to say that, right?  Well, it is certainly not that we are *against* inclusiveness--we just don't see the need to put any extra effort into promoting it.  Since anyone can join their DSUL, and since it is sufficiently easy to do, the inclusiveness issue will take care of itself.  At the same time, everyone is free to not join if they choose.  Nothing about the DSUp Project deprives citizens of the rights they already enjoy.  You can still vote in all the same elections you always did.  You still have the right to free speech and all the other rights that you've always had. If you don't want to participate in the direct legislature, that's your choice. We've made it as easy as humanly possible to join, but if you still don't want to join, that's up to you!  And we support you in your decision.   

The thing is, though, if you take that position, then, when laws are enacted or repealed, and you want to complain about it, you will sound quite silly.  Obviously, if you felt that way about an issue, you should have joined the direct legislature in your district, and said something, and voted.

Of course, this doesn't guarantee that anyone will listen to you.  You have to be persuasive. Also, this doesn't guarantee that the vote will go your way.  But it does guarantee that when the vote doesn't go your way, you get to complain about the stupid majority and their stupid decision! And, through the DSUL, you can tell them how stupid they are to their big fat stupid faces! And if you prevail, and you persuade enough voters, you may be able to reverse that stupid decision.  

Remember, we can only create a forum that offers equal power.  But equal power is probably *a lot more power* than you currently enjoy.

Of course, getting back to the stupid people with their stupid faces, from a practical perspective, derision and mockery may not be the best tools of persuasion. But you are free to use them if you choose, we won't stop you.  

On a related point, the DSUp Project does not encourage people to be 'less divisive.' We are not here to promote 'unity,' at least not beyond the basics: you must 'unite' to form a direct legislature, and you must 'unite' to go to the polls and vote for the person who your DSUL chose as its representative in congress. Such requirements are the same, in principle, as they were at the founding of the nation when we all had to 'unite' behind the creation of a government and the constitution.  But, after that foundational act of unity, we were free to go at each other as divisively as we wished. Whether we should or shouldn't be divisive is a different discussion, once that falls outside the perview of this project.

As a small digression, we'd like to share that an early incarnation of this project was called, "The Civil Democracy Project." We liked the word 'civil' because it implied 'civic' participation, which is to say, the involvement of the people rather than just the 'higher ups'.  But it also implies 'civility,' which has to do with treating each other with respect.

But then we realized we were being stinky. We were telling people how to behave and what ideas their behavior should embody. It may be someone's personal goal to be as respectful as possible, even to people whose point of view they find repugnant, even to people who are disrespectful towards them.  But who are we to try to enforce that goal on everyone?  Is there no role for disrespect?  Even when some group touts a philosophy that is almost universally regarded as deeply abhorrent?  

The upshot is, we are not trying to advocate for any particular mode of behavior once you've established your direct legislature and it is up and running.  Yes, your DSUL has to have rules of conduct, and people have to follow those rules, and there has to be a mechanism to address circumstances where members don't follow them. We want to help you work out these logistics. But we will not try to enforce any particular code of conduct--the rules for behavior within your DSUL, and mechanisms for enforcing those rules, will be entirely up to the members of your DSUL.      

### Partisanship

Is the DSUp Project bi-partisan? Surprisingly, perhaps, no, it is not.

Is it non-partisan?  Yes and no.

Is it all-partisan? Yes, yes it is.  

Is 'all-partisan' a word that we just made up?  We think it probably is.  

What does all that mean?

Not Bi-partisan:

Being bi-partisan means, specifically, where there are two major parties in a republic (such as ours), one party should not force legislation through without the participation of the other party. They should work together to come up with something they can both agree on. This is fine.  We're all for it, if that's what a group of legislators wants to do.  But can we say that there is never a time when it would be appropriate for a simple majority to force through legislation, turning a deaf ear to the protests of the minority?  No, we can't say that.  So we leave the question to you to answer. We do not *encourage* bi-partisanship.

Non-partisan:

Yes, our organization is non-partisan: this simply means that we don't distinguish between participants based on party affiliation, political ideology, positions on issues, etc. This is easy for us to do, actually, for two reasons: one, direct legislation is a fundamental right, and therefor, it applies to everyone regardless of what they believe.  Two, the DSUL is open to participation by everyone in the district--there is no way for us to keep anybody out.  So even if we tried to be sneaky, even if we purposely designed all of our outreach to encourage more participation from members of one party over the other, and even if that dastardly scheme worked, it wouldn't work for long.  Eventually, the people in the opposing party who we tried to leave out would simply join!  Of course, in reality, we would never engage in such non-sense and we don't want to. But isn't it good to know it would be useless for us to even try?

Also, no--our organization is *not* non-partisan:

This is only to clarify that while *we* must be non-partisan in the conduct of our organization, *you* may be as partisan as you please. That's why we like to say that we are all-partisan. That is, whatever your partisan affiliation, once you join a DSUL, you will be able to express yourself fully and freely without any sort of politically-correct shaming from the project itself. To be clear, this does not apply to actions that directly effect [the integrity of the vote.]({% post_url 2020-06-21-the-accuracy-of-the-vote %}) The vote is, of course, sacrosanct.  But other than that, we say, "You do you."  

This is perhaps putting too fine a point on it, but the problem with many democracy-oriented projects is that they seem to appeal, on their face, to one political persuasion or the other. For instance, if we start talking about 'being inclusive,' it sounds like we are chastising some particular political entity that is seen--rightly or wrongly--as being un-inclusive. When your democracy project pounds the table in favor of 'defending our rights and freedoms' you are casting some shade on a party that may have the reputation--rightly or wrongly--of not defending certain 'rights and freedoms'.

### Is Direct Legislation inherently, somehow, biased?

This is an interesting question. To answer it, we have to look at how political ideologies come into being.  

Clearly there are, in a general sense, two major political ideologies in the United States that are pitted against one another (at least from time to time...) But those two, seemingly opposing, points-of-view did not rise up, *sui generis,* from the waters beneath the earth.  They evolved within a social context--a context greatly shaped by the current form of democracy we practice.

That is to say, we have the political parties we have today, to some extent, because we have not had a system of direct legislation. The need to coalesce around an ideological position may be more a symptom of the ineptness and inefficiency engendered by a purely representative system (one that does not incorporate direct legislation,) rather than an unavoidable aspect of human nature. In the current system, to increase our personal power, we must join a party, and when we do so, we must sign-off on an entire party platform rather than making decisions issue by issue. Certainly, it is possible to say, "I belong to (a given political party,) but unlike most people in that party, I do not agree with (a given issue)." But that does you little good. Because when you vote for a candidate from that party, they will most likely vote against your position on that particular issue. There are exceptions and mixed-cases here, but the observation holds as a general rule.

So, it is hard to say that direct legislation is inherently politically ideological, since the political positions we currently know and love to hate will very likely take on a different character once direct legislation is the norm.  

The impact of direct legislation on political ideology is one of those things that is simply impossible to predict--though many will try to do so. Including us!  We do, in fact, predict that democracy will be better in all sorts of ways under a system of direct legislation. If we didn't think that, we wouldn't bother with the project at all.  But what if we are wrong?  What if we wind up making things way, way worse?  Gulp!

This is why we warn people not to look at direct legislation solely in terms of the possible future benefit it may offer, or any projected outcomes. This is simply the wrong way to look at it.

The right way to look at it is, direct legislation is a fundamental right, one that has been neglected up until now; we are merely finding a way to finally exercise that right.  Making it actually work is actually a separate issue. Trying to predict long-term and short-term outcomes is fun, and even useful, but the basic principle at work here is not dictated by those prospective outcomes.  The path forward is dictated by--once again--the exercise of that fundamental right that we all have to direct legislation.   

That being said, all predictions made at this point are likely to be wrong. Even ours! That is just the nature of the beast.  We are trying to do something that has never been done in human history.  There is nothing to compare it to. Predictions must rely on an assessment of the past.  "In the past, when this has happened, such and such has tended to follow." But you can't really know what will happen next, following in the aftermath of something that has never been done before.  Especially in the context of something that takes place on such a huge stage and effects an entire country.

Despite all that, we have every reason to be optimistic. Because if we do look at history, and focus on transitions that have lead to greater democracy, the outcomes haven't been too bad. Its important to remember that no one really knew what would happen after the founding of the United States. In fact, some people opined that it would all fall apart and revert back to monarchy before you knew it. This was a big fear, and much or our constitution was influenced by that fear. But it didn't happen.  Our screwed-up, imperfect democracy did not die, and lived to become much less screwed-up and a lot less imperfect.  

So, whatever happens after direct legislation, lets remember: our democracy will not die. Predictions will be made, both dire and rosy. Dire predictions are helpful--the prompt us to take action to avert those outcomes. Rosy predictions give us sustainance during a long period of struggle--but they may not pan out, so lets not pin all our hopes on them.  And though it has been said many times before, we say it again here: the best way to predict the future is to create it.
