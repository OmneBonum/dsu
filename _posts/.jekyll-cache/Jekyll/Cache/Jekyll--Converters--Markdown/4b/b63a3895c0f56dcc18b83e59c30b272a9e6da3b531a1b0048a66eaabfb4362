I"n<p>We need to drive home two points here: one, DSUp is not equivalent to e-Democracy. Two, a system of direct legislation has always been possible, at least in theory. Technology has simply made it easier.</p>

<p>But would a system of direct legislation really be possible without any modern technology at all?</p>

<p>This is an interesting thought to explore.  It helps to bring into focus the essential features of direct legislation, and to distinguish that which is enduring from that which is merely a product of the times.</p>

<p>So, direct legislation in 1820.  What would that look like?</p>

<p>Now, if you imagine every eligible voter in a democracy pouring over every single word in every single piece of legislation</p>

<p>[end] Perhaps the most powerful takeaway here is that what has, up to this point, prevented the realization of direct legislation is not the development of ‘hard’ technologies, like digital information systems, but the development of ‘soft’ technologies: the rules, tacit and explicit, that govern the interrelationships among human beings, and that shape each individual’s scope.</p>
