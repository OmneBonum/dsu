<!--[every individual has a limit to how much time and energy they can devote to the process of legislating.  Heaping the responsibility on every individual is actually a way to keep people down.  It is similar to the CEO of a start-up that insists on doing everything themselves.  In the early stages, okay, but eventually the CEO has to let-go or the company will fail.  In the same way, the individual needs to learn to delegate.  Link to many-headed CEO.]-->
