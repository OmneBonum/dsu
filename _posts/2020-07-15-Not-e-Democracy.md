The DSUp Project has a lot that sets it apart from other efforts to increase democratic decision-making.

Probably the largest distinction relative to all previous efforts is that we are going to Just Do It! without putting any obstacles in our own way.  

### e-Democracy

There is something called "e-Democracy" out there in the world.  It has its appeal and its advocates are not completely wrong.  But they are wrong enough to warrant correction.

Whenever a model of e-Democracy is built on a foundation of on-line, digital communication, its designers have made a grave error.  DSUp is based on face-to-face, in person communication.   We regard this as one of the 'fundamental truths' of self-government by means of direct legislation.  

This is not to say that the digital world should be ignored. If DSUp were implemented decades ago, we would be using fax machines, telephones, computer databases etc., to make communication and information-gathering easier. But it would be clear to us that these were merely tools.

In the same way, the digital age has offered up a powerful set of tools.  But it is critical to remember that direct legislation could have been implemented at any point in the history of our country.  Arguably, it would have been so incredibly slow and clunky as to be impractical.  So, perhaps, we should say that direction legislation was always 'theoretically' possible. We can comfort ourselves that we were not obliged to implement a system that would have been unmanageable and catastrophically inefficient--even though, all the while, direct legislation was as fundamental to our human rights as universal suffrage, freedom of speech, etc. That being the case, we were only postponing the creation of the framework for direct legislation until such a time as it became feasible--in much the same way that there may be a gap of many years between knowledge of how to cure a disease, and the ability to effectively disseminate that cure throughout an entire population.  But, once the technology and infrastructure exist to do it, failure to implement the cure becomes gross negligence.

This is to say that, even if the digital age has made direct legislation possible, whereas before it might not have been, that does not mean that the foundations of it emanate from a digital space, or some kind of virtual reality slash virtual democracy.

So, the criticism here is that the proponents of so-called e-Democracy leap from "So much can now be done on-line" to "Let's do everything on-line," or worse, "It is better to do everything on-line because it is more efficient."

Which brings us to the necessity of  [face-to-face communication.]({% post_url 2020-07-13-Face-to-face %})

### Direct democracy

Don't be deceived by the similar-sounding names.  'Direct democracy' and 'direct legislation' are two distinct concepts.

Direct democracy contrasts with representative democracy, which is our syste here in the United States.  

In a direct democracy, there is no legislature other than the voters themselves.  That is, there are no representatives in between the base and the enactment of a law.  

Direct democracy is often viewed as, in many ways, desirable, at least in theory, but impossible to implement in practice.  

As mentioned elsewhere, DSUp is a cross between direct democracy and representative democracy.  It combines the two in order to create the best of both worlds.  Direct democracy with no system of representation would be a free-for-all, little better than a mosh pit.  But, a system of representation without direct legislation, our current system, while it adds a bit of order, doesn't really remedy the chaos.  More like some people are dutifully trying to line-dance...in a mosh pit.  

### Democracy by referenda

This essentially restates the premise of direct democracy, but it is worth singling out for discussion.  

We already have a system that includes the use of referenda.  So, it is easy to imagine (wrongly, it must be emphasized), that Democracy Straight-Up! is just a system of referenda on steroids.  

One obvious distinction is that referenda are placed on electoral ballots, where as direct legislation can be voted on, schedule permitting, any day congress is in session. But the difference goes much deeper.

Referenda have all the weaknesses of direct democracy.  The voters are addressed *en masse* through the media. It is unavoidable that proponents on both sides of the question posed by a referendum will strive to stir up emotion and engage in polemical argument. The process takes a huge amount of energy, money, and time, because each new issue has to find a way to organize itself into a new movement.  

The referenda process necessarily preys on voters emotionally, seeks to sow confusion, and provides biased information.  Now, there is nothing wrong with having emotions--but how many emotions can you have in any given day? How long can you walk around being outraged by everything that needs to be decided in our democracy?  How much confusion can you, personally, sift through to find real information?  These questions touch on the issue of Individual Responsibility [link].

The problem with referenda is that, as they exist now, they are mostly a desperate attempt to paper over the inherent flaws in the form of representative democracy we currently practice.  Ultimately they arise when legislatures, for whatever reason, don't want to make a decision. Or, more charitably, they know their constituents don't have a well-formed opinion, and they hope the referenda process will bombard them with enough information from all sides that somehow they will come to a more well-formed opinion. But this is a poor way for the citizenry to become informed, to engage in deliberation, and to come to a conclusion on an issue that effects everyone in society.

### Liquid Democracy

If you've ever heard of Liquid Democracy, you may be wondering how it differs from the system of direct legislation proposed by the Democracy Straight-Up! Project.

Well, the truth is, it really doesn't differ all that much!

Our proposal can be most accurately described as a form of liquid democracy, although please be aware that there are subtle and important distinctions to be made.  

So, why don't we just call this the Liquid Democracy Project?

Two reasons: first, liquid democracy is a stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid name.  It's unattractive, misleading, it says nothing, and we just don't like it.  

The second reason is because Google.  

At some point Google was experimenting with some form of Liquid Democracy, but only in-house (we think, we hope).  Now there is nothing wrong with this as far as it goes.  But the idea of a large corporation launching a project like this one fills us with dread, horror, and fear.  

Another problem is, in our opinion, they got the fundamentals wrong.  Is you are not yet familiar with the inevitable and unavoidable tiered system of delegation and proxy voting that is at the core of any working system of direct legislation, the distinction might seem unimportant. But the articulation of the idea of liquid democracy that we heard about involved delegates campaigning on issues to gain supporters and become their representatives.

This is a strategy that we are very much against, and it is worth taking a good look at it. In the DSUp system, individuals first form small groups--we are still mulling over what to call these groups, but they should consist of six to twelve people who all know each other and don't mind talking to each other. They don't have to agree on everything, but they should get along. And if they do agree on everything, that's a good thing--it makes the job of their delegate easier.

Anyway, in DSUp, people get together in a group and then elect from among their number a delegate.  The same thing, in essence, happens at every tier.  The delegates form small groups and elect one of their members to be a delegate for that group, and so on, creating a tree that spans between the representative in congress and every single voter.  

At each stage, the group forms first, and then the delegate is selected. In the Google model we saw, the delegate decides they want to represent people, but only on a specific issue, and they goes around 'campaigning' to sign up 'supporters,' to, in essence, join a group of some unspecified size.   

We see this as a huge mistake.  The kind of glad-handing, appeasing, and positioning oneself to win support that is a necessary part of the current system--this is exactly what we are trying to avoid. Members of the base would, in this scenario, be peppered with a constant stream of persistent voices trying to win them over to some side or other of every issue. And it does not solve (perhaps exacerbates) the problem of the type of person who is attracted to being a politician.  There is a world of difference between the type of person who is promoted to a position of authority based on the trust invested in them by those who know them best, and a person who seeks out authority and does whatever it takes to get it.  

And lets not forget what a deal-breaker it would be for a mega-corporation, like a Google, a Facebook, etc., to try to implement a nation-wide project that involves a system of voting bills into law. There are issues of trust, bias, and self-interest that simply can't be remedied.  The entity that initiates a project like this has to be independent, and has to be not-for-profit.  

Remember, by the way, that DSUp only aims to establish direct legislatures in every district.  Emphasis on the word 'establish'. Each DSUL is, by definition, autonomous and self-governing.  In the early stages, we will be facilitating the operations of your DSUL to get you up and running. But ultimately, you'll be handling everything yourselves. That means that things like websites and data, as well as the internal system of organization for your district legislature, will be entirely under your control.

### Cellular democracy

It is likely you have not heard of cellular democracy, or Fred Foldvary, the economist that developed it.  Heck, we'd have never heard of it if someone hadn't added it to Wikipedia!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_democracy

And, even then, it is, as of this writing, suspected of not meeting the 'notability' requirement. So let's help make the idea tad more notable by giving it some consideration.  

According to Foldvary's plan "a jurisdiction such as a county or city is divided into neighborhood districts with a population of about 500 people, with about 100 to 200 households." So, right off the bat, we have a system where the proposed fundamental unit of organization is much larger in size than ours. But, to be fair, this larger unit is free to self-organize however it wishes and could put in place something close to what we describe.  

Notice there is a bit of a top-down mechanism in play here, where jurisdictions are 'divided' into 'neighborhoods.' We have decided to shy away from any process that involves prescribing more geographic boundaries than already exist. While the 'neighborhood' is a commonplace entity in common speech, we worry it would be devilishly difficult to define and delineate in a way that would be sufficiently satisfactory. DSUp proposes we proceed within the restrictions of the legacy handed down to us by the current system.  That means we are stuck working within the existing boundaries of our legislative districts. (If the word 'gerrymandering' just popped into your head, see this discussion.) One of the guiding principles of our project is that we don't seek re-invent anything if we can work with what we have. The 435 congressional districts in the US don't need to be redrawn for DSUp's vision of direct legislation to work.  And they don't need to be divvied up, by us or anyone else, in a top down way, into neighborhoods or smaller units.  The idea is that, for the purposes of forming a direct legislature, you can caucus with whoever you want in your district, whether they live next door or miles away.  But remember, you will be restricted to 'grouping' with other members of your district only when it comes to the operations of your direct legislature.  There is nothing to stop you from grouping together with others, inside and outside your district, based on any issue or for any reason you like. In fact, your DSUL itself could help facilitate this kind of networking.  We see this as one of the benefits of the project.

[create new file for DSUL membership criteria]

It also seems that Foldvary's version of democracy focuses local control over a wide range administrative functions. It's not clear to us that the 'councils' he proposes have legislative power, though that may simply be due to the brevity of the description we consulted.  But, whatever his ideas on the subject may be, the issue of 'what is controlled' is pertinent here, because we are proposing a singular focus on federal legislation.

So, what about all that other stuff?  Stop signs, noise ordinances, buying new equipment for the firefighters, etc. The idea, of course, is to reach such decisions in a way that is more democratic, and gives localities more autonomy. Why doesn't DSUp address that sort thing?

It does, actually, and in a very powerful way. If we want to re-engineer how all those local kinds of things are done, we are going to need a platform from which to make our plans.  As your DSUL evolves, it will undoubtedly serve as a platform to enable the creation of whatever mechanisms of local control you wish to implement. And the Democracy Straight-Up! Project hopes to work with you to facilitate that process in the years to come. (Or you can tell us, at some point, to take a hike.  Our feelings will be hurt, but we will soldier on.)

We emphasize that your DSUL can and will do things other than voting directly on federal legislation.  Eventually.  It's going to take a lot of effort just to get over that first hurdle, however, so we have to try not to get ahead of ourselves.  

There is a very good reason to tackle the national level first. It is only through federal law that we can create the kind of environment where local efforts can survive and thrive. Think about it.  Local efforts routinely hit a ceiling, where they are limited (some would say thwarted) by the legal and regulatory framework imposed on them in a top-down manner.  That is why, if greater local autonomy is what you're looking for, you have to start with the overarching body of laws that place conditions upon, and also facilitate and even fund, that autonomy.  

"Act nationally, think locally." New bumper sticker.

Foldvary, like us, proposes a tiered system of representative bodies--in his case they are called 'councils'. This strengthens our conviction concerning the unavoidable inevitability of a tiered system of delegation.

Finally, perhaps because he is an economist, Foldvary sees his 'councils' as being empowered to raise revenue. We are not proposing that your DSUL have the power-of-the-purse in your district. However, since every district is ultimately self-organizing, we can't rule anything out.  We just can't weigh in on it--something like that is too far down the road and none of our business.

But another interesting point is raised. Will your DSUL need funds in order to function? If so, what would be the source of those funds? See Fun with Funding.

### Town Hall Meeting

Any fans of the TV show Gilmore Girls?  One of the recurring segments in that production is a town hall meeting--thirty or forty people who all live in the same small Connecticut town, sit in folding chairs facing a dias where the town mayor stands.  He keeps the town informed about what's going on in the administration of the town, makes proposals, and takes votes by a show of hands.  

Now, nothing about DSUp will prevent a town from having such a meeting.  But notice how it is not the fundamental unit we advocate, and, in fact, at no point in the process of participating in your DSUL at any level will you be subjected to anything resembling this kind of torture.  

We call it torture because, well, it is.  You sit there quietly in your folding chair while someone with a license to ramble goes on and on about something you don't know or care about. Usually, you're only there for one reason, one issue you care about, and you're just waiting for your chance to talk about it or vote on it.  Worse yet, it might be one of those meetings were a long string of people get to walk up to a microphone and advocate for whatever cause has brought them there.  

This would be the town or city council meeting that is open to the public.  Very few people attend these meetings regularly.  Mostly its people showing up for the first time because there is something they have a particular beef about.  And while an articulate advocate might appear and give a rousing speech to councilpersons arrayed before them, often as not it is just a nut-job on a tirade.  If you attend, you just have to sit there and take it while pieces of your soul are chipped off and fall to the floor.  

Even when this process works, even when it is productive, it is excruciatingly slow, inefficient and ultimately dehumanizing.

We want to put this in sharp contrast to direct legislation the DSUp way.  For fully 90% of participants, this is what participation will look and feel like:

You will never need to attend a meeting more than once a year, if that.  That is, when you create a pod, we do recommend you all get together at least once. Optionally, you might also reassemble whenever a new member joins the group. But we recommend that this be nothing more than a meet and greet. Have some snacks. Drink some adult beverages. Hold it in your living room or on the patio. These should be people you enjoy discussing issues with, so go ahead and do that, the same way you would at a dinner party or a backyard barbecue.   

Of course, your DSUL is free to create some sort of an issue-based forum that you are welcome to attend.  But the point is, you really don't have to. You can just send your delegate and have them fill you in later, if you're interested.

In order for a system of direct legislation to work, the requirements for meaningful participation--that is, having the power of that direct vote on every bill--must be achievable by the vast majority of citizens no matter their personal situation. Just as you can be expected to register to vote, and to actually vote in elections, you can be expected to do two simple things no matter who you are: join a pod, and elect a delegate to represent it.

### Demarchy or Sortition

There are a couple of words you don't hear every day.  

Sortition actually has its roots in Athenian democracy. Every citizen was eligible to participate in a forum where votes were taken on various issues--a kind of direct democracy. But there were too many citizens to fit in the forum on any given day--the perennial problem of a true direct democracy. Ideally, though, every citizen should have an equal chance of winding up in the forum and voting on any given day it was in session.

To 'sort out' those who would participate, a long rope was walked through the marketplace and people on one side of it would be ushered into the meeting place to participate in the voting.  Of course, sometimes people didn't want to go, so they ducked under the rope and ran off.  To remedy this problem, the rope was coated with a red powder--so if you got red on your tunic, you couldn't escape your civic duty.  This is the origin of the red velvet ropes we still use today at special events.

(At least that's our story and we're sticking to it.)

So, the Athenian example is a basic form of sortition, the idea behind demarchy. Another variation is, when officials need to be elected or appointed to some function, a large pool of qualified candidates is first identified, and then the final choice as to who fills which position is made by random drawing.

The cool thing about this is that it eliminates the idea of campaigning or making any sort of promises, empty or otherwise, to the voters--because they aren't really voting.  The voters do give their assent to the larger pool of potential candidates, selected for their general level of competence rather than any distinct positions they may hold.  And, under the assumption that any one of them is likely to be as good at the job as any other, the voters allow a roll of the dice to make the final decision.

We have nothing against this technique, and you might want to experiment with using it in your DSUL at some point. It's not a device that we build into the process of getting your DSUL up-and-running, however. But, again, any processes you want to put into place once you're off the launch pad, that's up to you.  

There is a modern phenomenon we've heard about that also uses sortition.  A group of citizens are randomly selected to participate in a process of learning about an issue and deciding how to deal with it.  This can take place over a series of days, weeks or months. Consideration is given to making sure all participants have all the information they need, and to allowing sufficient time and an appropriate forum for discussion and deliberation.  In this process, such a group of people can even shape the specific language of a specific piece of legislation.

Surprisingly, if the group selected is truly random, and the group size is sufficiently large--and 'sufficiently large' is probably smaller than you think--the final decision made by this sample of the population will most often accurately reflect the decision that would be made by the entire population if absolutely everyone participated in the same process.

We like this device too. It's a better version of the sub-committee system that congress uses.  Many issues are mulled over by a small fraction of the congress which then reports their recommendations to the larger body. Some kind of division of labor is always going to be necessary when dealing with many complicated issues on a daily basis.  But, of course, their system of assigning members to those sub-committees is not random.  Assignments are deeply political and therefore bias is at play.  There is no great probability that the decision reached by a sub-committee would reflect the decision that would be reached by the entire congress if they were to participate in the same process.  

But we will recommend sortition as a good way for your DSUL to create issue-based sub-committees that are truly random, and therefore truly representative.

Let us now ask, if sortition is so great, why isn't the DSUp Project using it as an organizing principle.  We could ask people to sign up to serve in one of a number of working groups, each focused on some specific issue, and then randomly choose people to join each group.  We could then engage in the process, as described above, of reaching a decision, or signing off on a specific piece of legislation.  What's wrong with that?

A couple of things.  No matter how confident we are that the final decision of this committee accurately reflects the will of the entire population in question, the fact is, many people did not even have the option of participating.  As a non-participant, how do I know that each committee has arrived at the same decision they would have made had I been able to participate?  I don't have the same information, the same testimony, the same reports, etc.  I haven't sat through the entire process and engaged in the discussion and debate.

Worse, if I am very passionate about the issue, why was I, essentially, barred from involvement because of some 'random' process of selection?

This is why we need the DSUL. The forum that decides whether or not such a system of issue-focused, citizen-based committees should exist, and what form it should take, that forum must be all-inclusive, and decisions must be reached through an open and democratic process.  Who are we, here at the DSUp Project, to get out a long rope and start herding people into groups and telling them what issue they have to decide?  Its not our place. It's up to you guys.

### Consensus democracy

Consensus can mean different things to different people.  It can mean, "We keep discussing the issue until absolutely everyone agrees on what to do about it," or it can mean, "Not absolutely everyone, but the vast majority of people have to agree before we proceed," or some variation on that theme.

Consensus if often put forth as a goal to aspire towards, an ideal to be realized.  We here at the DSUp Project do not share this goal, and we do not embrace this ideal.

Have you ever participated in a process where the goal of consensus was imposed on a diverse group of people who had to make a decision?  It is a tedious, unsatisfying experience.  It isn't a process of convincing the minority of the value of the argument being made by the majority.  It's process of wearing the minority down to a shiny nub, until they lose the will to fight and just say, "Whatever, okay, yes." Its a process that promotes self-righteous bullying and quashes individuality.  

That said, any group at any tier in your DSUL could decide "We aren't going to vote on anything unless every single one of us agrees." We can't stop you from doing that, and we wouldn't want to.  But we are not going to recommend it as an aspirational goal, either.

A variation on this would be to decide, say, that your DSUL will vote to enact no law unless 60% of the membership approves.  Or 80% or 90% or what have you.  The US Senate often uses a rule like this in some cases (the so-called supermajority).  Again, if that's what you want to do in your group, go right ahead.  

But the problem with a supermajority is, while it might keep people honest most of the time, it has to be voted in by a simple majority, and the rule can be voted out by a simple majority. The same is true of consensus.  The goal of striving for consensus has to be shared by a simple majority before the process even gets started.  As soon as a simple majority changes its mind on that goal, it disappears.

For this reason, the DSUp Project assumes that all votes will be decided by a simple majority, and we leave decisions about forming consensus and requiring a supermajority up to the individual DSUL.

### Leaderless Movements

The most notorious example of an attempt at a leaderless movement was Occupy Wall Street.  To our knowledge, that movement accomplished absolutely nothing.

To be fair, their leeriness when it came to leadership was based on some truths.  Leaders often disappoint.  The type of person who says, "Oo, pick me!  I'll be your leader!" isn't always the kind of person you actually want for the job.  There is, of course, that truism about power corrupting.  

But the problem goes a bit deeper than that. The real problem with leadership is the followers.  The fact is, they only have a vague idea of the realities their leader faces when trying, even in good conscience to champion their cause.

For instance, it is often necessary to make some sort of concession to other forces at work in the society. Deals need to be struck. Compromises made.  And, unless you're there 'in the room where it happened,' these measures can look unseemly, unnecessary or opportunistic. Worse yet, such maneuvers, while possibly justified, can make it look like the leader is betraying the base.  

And the existence of a leader does arguably engender a kind of passivity in those who follow.  

We at the Democracy Straight-Up! Project don't feel its our job to tell people whether or not they should have leaders.  We find it hard to believe, though, that DSULs will routinely elect delegates without any 'leadership qualities.'  Even though your representative in congress will be 'following the lead' of the voters when it comes to how to vote, how to negotiate with other districts, and what to argue on the floor of the house, its hard to imagine, even then, that such a person would not be able to inspire loyalty and trust, would not be able to address their own constituents and make convincing case on an issue, even when it counters what the majority sentiment had been up to that point.  

At the same time, the branching structure of a direct legislature has to converge on a group of about ten people who meet directly with the elected representative. (more on that here) That group of people are essentially as qualified to be the elected representative as the representative her/his self. And, in fact, they could form a leadership team, and divvy up the various responsibilities involved in being a member of congress.  But each member of the team would have, potentially, as many as 50,000 constituents behind them, and some, perhaps large, number of discretionary votes--proxies--at their disposal.  So the representative would remain the leader, but more of a leader among equals.  

All of these dynamics will serve to dilute some of the more unseemly aspects of leadership, and place a solid emphasis on accountability. Of course, a representative can get away with doing whatever her/his constituents allow.  But a direct legislature, properly designed, will constitute a great deal of monitoring and oversight. It will be hard for a representative to get away with any monkey business.  

### Opinion Polling

A direct legislature is not the same as opinion polling.
