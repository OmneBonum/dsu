Here's the thing. You know how sometimes, if you're using a public bathroom, somebody might have written
something on the wall. There might be something scratched into the paint in somewhat murderous-looking
letters.  Obscenities, crude poetry, random rants, unflattering caricatures, etc.

For some reason I remember seeing in the bathroom stall of the boy's room of the middle school I attended,
"For a Good Time Call Wanda," followed by a phone number.

Obviously, I never once wrote down that number and tried to call Wanda. Even if I had
done so, I would not have expected Wanda to answer in a sultry voice, saying, "Hey, you
must have gotten my message, sailor. Wanna have a good time?"  

No, I naturally assumed that it was a bad joke, that there was no one named Wanda, or, indeed, any other person of any description who would be delighted if I called. If it was a working number, then it was the target
of a prank, a cruel trick, maliciously placed so the intended victim might be called at all hours by randy strangers,
or really, in this case, it being a middle school bathroom, mischievous sixth-graders.

This used to be how we looked at such information in general, wasn't it? We knew, instinctively,
that it was bad information.  We knew this because the information had no knowable source,
we didn't know who wrote it. It could have been anybody. And some people are crazy. And some people
are just, well, not very nice. The information also had a bad
context.  A bathroom wall is a terrible place to transmit serious or important messages. Because of
these, and other factors, the information had a very low probability of being useful or accurate. We knew this.

But then, the internet came along.  

Nowadays people see unsourced, anonymous, messages that aren't transmitted in any credible context
and they suddenly launch into dire flights of ideation. Equivalently---staying with the bathroom wall analogy---they
think, "Oh, my God, is that true? Is Wanda soliciting men for sex? It could be Wanda Jankowitz! Is she turning tricks?  Why does
she need the money? For drugs?  Oh, my God, Wanda Jankowitz is a crack whore! And she's only
in sixth grade! What is this world coming to?"

That's kind of where we are at, people.

Admittedly, this is not a completely fair comparison.  A lot of great information is transmitted
all day long, zillions of times per second, on social media, in ways that are effectively anonymous and unsourced. For instance, should I trust the people on line commenting on the recipes I'd like to try out?  I have no good reason to believe these
strangers have my best interests at heart.  But, I also have long experience with human
nature, and I know that there aren't scads of people that get their kicks out of giving deliberately bad
and misleading cooking advice in the comments section of a food blog.  

However, when it comes to politics, which is intimately tied with money and power---well, we all have
long experience with that, now don't we?  We know that anonymous, unsourced comments, accusations,
innuendo, gossip, etc., have a high probability of being politically motivated fabrications, and should not be taken
too seriously.  

We know that, right?  I mean, no journalist would ever write a newspaper article about what
a group of anonymous people are saying on social media.  That's not news. They would no sooner write an
article titled, "Wanda: Should we Call Her for a Good Time? We Ask the Experts."  Journalists have integrity, and readers
are discerning---they would never put up with that...would they?

Of course they would!  Journalists do that all the time! Because of the internet, it's like they are looking at
one, long, continuous bathroom wall and going, "Say, I notice a lot of occurrences of this name 'Wanda,' often
associated with some kind of phone number and a sexually suggestive offer. Could there be something to it?"

[Sound of a long, exasperated sigh.]

All of this is by way of saying that we at Democracy Straight-Up Headquarters will have a rule about
the forums we engage in.  We aren't going to join in any 'discussion' where unknown people with
unknown motivations can say whatever the hell they want. We aren't going to tweet, so other tweeters can tweet
outrage at the audacious insensitivity of our tweets. We aren't going
to put up a Facebook page and invite people to 'like' us as if we had, as a group, some sort of massive
insecurity complex. When we put up content, we are not going
to have a convenient little comment section where THE ENEMIES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY CAN SPEW THEIR VILE POISON!

Sorry, got a bit carried away there.

This is not to say that people won't discuss the project on social media.  We expect they will.  Just
remember this: all such discussions are subject to the lessons we learned back in middle school about the writing we find written on bathroom walls.

Look, we are not pulling a Holden Caufield here. (The main character of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Catcher in the Rye</span>, by J.D. Salinger, who, notably, wanted to go around erasing all the F-you's from
all the bathroom walls all over the world. You people should really read more.) Social media exists, it has its place, we sometimes enjoy it ourselves. But
it is not right for our project. It's not useful for making serious or important decisions. And
we are pushing back against the well-intentioned people who think that, in order for The Project to succeed, we
have no choice but to jump into that particular mosh pit, never mind the bloody head injuries.

Well, we do have a choice, and we're not jumping in.

(Okay, true, some of these people look like they are having fun.  The ones that aren't being crushed to death.)
