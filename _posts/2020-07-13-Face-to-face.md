The basis of DSUp is face-to-face, in-person communication. However, this does not mean that all, or even the majority, of the communication you'll be involved in as a participant in the process of direct legislation will be in person.  Of course we should make use of telephones and computers and everything in between. Not to mention snail-mail, which still has its place, and, if you insist, fax machines and the like.  

But, as you will see, the fundamental unit of organization in DSUp is a small group of people, small enough to fit in your living room, who all know each other.

This is not an arbitrary or optional criteria.  Without this unit of organization, direct legislation will not work.
